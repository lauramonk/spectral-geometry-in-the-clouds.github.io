                    We initiate an approach to simultaneously treat numerators and denominators of Green's functions
                    arising from quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators, which in particular allows us to study
                    completely resonant phases of the almost Mathieu operator.
                    <br>
                    Let \((H_{\lambda,\alpha,\theta}u) (n)=u(n+1)+u(n-1)+ 2\lambda \cos2\pi(\theta+n\alpha)u(n)\) be
                    the almost Mathieu operator on \(\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})\), where \(\lambda, \alpha, \theta\in
                    \mathbb{R}\).
                    Let \( \beta(\alpha)=\limsup_{k\rightarrow \infty}-\frac{\ln
                    ||k\alpha||_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}}{|k|}\).
                    We prove that for any \(\theta\) with \(2\theta\in \alpha \mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}\),
                    \(H_{\lambda,\alpha,\theta}\)
                    satisfies Anderson localization if \(|\lambda|>e^{2\beta(\alpha)}\).

                    The spectral theory of the Laplace operator on graphs offers many analogies with that of Riemannian
                    manifolds, like Cheeger type inequalities, but also shows some different phenomena.
                    For hypergraphs, a main step consists in the definition of a Laplace operator that can also offer
                    such analogies.
                    Lovasz extensions of Rayleigh quotients can uncover some deeper reasons behind such analogies.

                Quantum ergodicity for expanding quantum graphs in the regime of spectral delocalization

                    The aim of the talk is to discuss the phenomenon of "quantum ergodicity" of eigenfunctions on large
                    expander graphs. We will start with the work of Anantharaman-Le Masson and Anantharaman-Sabri
                    concerning discrete graphs, but the goal is to prove similar results for large quantum graphs. Last
                    year, we proved the same statement for quantum graphs that had been obtained for discrete graphs :
                    if a sequence of finite quantum expander graphs "converges" to an infinite tree, and the latter has
                    purely absolutely continuous spectrum in some given interval \(I\), then "most" of the
                    eigenfunctions of
                    the finite graphs with frequency in \(I\) are delocalized in the sense of quantum ergodicity (which
                    is a
                    rather weak notion of delocalization). Note that the size of the graph goes to infinity, not the
                    frequency, and that we are now dealing with unbounded Schrödinger operators, which modifies a lot
                    the arguments, although the phenomenon is the same at the end. This is joint work with M. Ingremeau,
                    M. Sabri, B. Winn. After stating the result, the talk will mostly be dedicated to the definition of
                    Benjamini-Schramm convergence (which is new for quantum graphs) and to examples where the result
                    applies.

                    In this talk I will show that the Morse index of the critical Moebius band in the 4-dimensional
                    Euclidean ball equals 5. This result makes use of the quartic Hopf differential technique and a
                    comparison theorem between the index of a free boundary minimal surface in the Euclidean ball and
                    its spectral index. The latter also enables us to reprove a well-known result that the index of the
                    critical catenoid in the 3-ball equals 4. These results are obtained in my paper in progress.

                    In this talk we present a comparison between the normalized first (non-trivial) Neumann eigenvalue
                    \(|\Omega| \mu_1(\Omega)\) for a Lipschitz open set \(\Omega\) in the plane, and the normalized
                    first (non-trivial)
                    Steklov
                    eigenvalue \(P(\Omega) \sigma_1 (\Omega)\).
                    More precisely, we study the ratio \(F (\Omega) := |\Omega| \mu_1 (\Omega)/P (\Omega)
                    \sigma_1(\Omega)\). We prove that this ratio can
                    take arbitrarily small or large values if we do not put any restriction on the class of sets
                    \(\Omega\). Then
                    we restrict ourselves to the class of plane convex domains for which we get explicit bounds. We
                    also study the case of thin convex domains for which we give more precise bounds.
                    In the last part of the talk we present the corresponding Blaschke-Santaló diagrams \((x, y) =
                    (|\Omega|\mu_1 (\Omega), P (\Omega) \sigma_1 (\Omega))\) and we state some open problems.
                    This talk is based on a joint work with Antoine Henrot.

                    surfaces, focusing on the size of the first non-zero eigenvalue i.e. the spectral gap. We shall
                    introduce
                    a model for random surfaces, arising from the Weil-Petersson metric on moduli space. Then we shall

                    The spectral theory of non-selfadjoint operators is an old and highly developed subject. Yet it
                    still poses
                    many new challenges crucial for the understanding of modern problems such as scattering systems,
                    open or damped quantum systems, the analysis of the stability of solutions to non-linear PDEs, and
                    many more. The lack of powerful tools readily available for their selfadjoint counterparts, such a
                    general
                    spectral theorem or variational methods, makes the analysis of the spectra of non-selfadjoint
                    operators
                    a subtle and highly varied subject.
                    One fundamental issue of non-selfadjoint operators is their intrinsic sensitivity to perturbations,
                    indeed
                    even small perturbations can change the spectrum dramatically. This spectral instability, also
                    called
                    pseudospectral effect, was initially considered a drawback as it can be at the origin of severe
                    numerical
                    errors. However, recent works in semiclassical analysis and random matrix theory have shown that
                    this
                    pseudospectral effect also leads to new and beautiful results concerning the spectral distribution
                    and
                    eigenvector localization of non-selfadjoint operators with small random perturbations.
                    In this talk, I will discuss recent results and some fundamental techniques involved in the
                    analysis.
                    The talk is partly based on joint work with Anirban Basak, Stéphane Nonnenmacher, Johannes
                    Sjöstrand and Ofer Zeitouni.

                    On a compact surface of variable negative curvature, I will explain that
                    the Poincaré series associated to the geodesic arcs joining two given
                    points has a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane. This
                    is achieved by using the spectral properties of the geodesic flow.
                    Moreover, the value of Poincaré series value at 0 is rationnal in that
                    case and it can be expressed in terms of the genus of the surface by
                    interpreting it in terms of the linking of two Legendrian knots. If time
                    permits, I will explain how this result extends when one considers
                    geodesic arcs orthogonal to two fixed closed geodesics. This is a joint
                    work with N.V. Dang.

                    We will discuss some recent results regarding the number of nodal domains of Laplace and
                    Schrödinger operators. Improving on Courant's seminal work, Pleijel's original proof in 1956 was
                    only for domains in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with Dirichlet boundary conditions, but it was later
                    generalized
                    to manifolds (Peetre and Bérard-Meyer) with Dirichlet boundary conditions, then to planar domains
                    with Neumann Boundary conditions (Polterovich, Léna), but also to the quantum harmonic oscillator
                    (C.) and to Schrödinger operators with radial potentials (C. - Helffer - Hoffmann-Ostenhof). In
                    this recent work, we proved Pleijel's asymptotic upper bound for a much larger class of
                    Schrödinger operators which are not necessarily radial. In this talk, I will explain the problems
                    that arise from studying Schrödinger operators as well as the successive improvements in the
                    methods that led to the current results.

                    Just over a decade ago, Fraser and Schoen initiated the study of metrics maximizing the first
                    Steklov eigenvalue among all metrics of fixed boundary length on a given surface with boundary.
                    Drawing inspiration from the maximization problem for Laplace eigenvalues on closed surfaces--where
                    maximizing metrics are induced by minimal immersions into spheres — they showed that
                    Steklov-maximizing metrics are induced by free boundary minimal immersions into Euclidean balls, and
                    laid the groundwork for an existence theory (recently completed by important work of
                    Matthiesen-Petrides). In this talk, I'll describe joint work with Mikhail Karpukhin, characterizing
                    the limiting behavior of these metrics on surfaces of fixed genus \(g\) and \(k\) boundary
                    components as \(k\)
                    becomes large. In particular, I'll explain why the associated free boundary minimal surfaces
                    converge to the closed minimal surface of genus \(g\) in the sphere given by maximizing the first
                    Laplace eigenvalue, with areas converging at a rate of \((\log k)/k\).

                    The Berry Tabor conjecture predicts that the local statistics of eigenvalues of a regular system is
                    Poissonian, at least in generic cases. In this talk, I consider the special case of flat tori which
                    has the attractive feature that arithmetic tools become available. I will explain some ideas and
                    methods from analytic number theory that shed light on this question, in particular with respect to
                    small gaps, large gaps and triple correlation. This covers joint papers with Aistleitner, Bourgain,

                    It is a conjecture going back to J. Rauch (1974) that the hottest and coldest spots in an insulated
                    homogeneous medium such as an insulated
                    plate of metal should converge to the boundary, for "most" initial heat distributions, as time tends
                    to infinity. This so-called hot spots conjecture can be phrased alternatively as follows: the
                    eigenfunction(s) corresponding to the first non-zero eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian
                    on a Euclidean domain should take its maximum and minimum on the boundary only. This has been proven
                    to be false for certain domains with
                    holes, but it was shown to hold for several classes of simply connected or convex planar domains.
                    One of the most recent advances is the proof for all triangles given by Judge and Mondal (Annals of
                    Math. 2020). The conjecture remains open in general for simply connected or at least convex domains.
                    In this talk we provide a new approach to the conjecture. It is based on a non-standard variational
                    principle for the eigenvalues of the Neumann and Dirichlet Laplacians.

                    In this talk I shall present constructions of Schrödinger operators with complex-valued potentials
                    whose spectra exhibit interesting properties. One example shows that for sufficiently large \(p\),
                    namely \(p>(d+1)/2\) where \(d\) is the dimension, the discrete eigenvalues need not be bounded by
                    the
                    \(L^p\) norm of the potential. This is a counterexample to the Laptev—Safronov conjecture (Comm.
                    Math. Phys. 2009).
                    Another construction proves optimality (in some sense) of generalisations of Lieb—Thirring
                    inequalities to the non-selfadjoint case - thus giving us information about the accumulation rate of
                    the discrete eigenvalues to the essential spectrum.

                    The \(H\)-functional \(E\) is a natural variant of the Dirichlet energy along maps \(u\) from a
                    closed surface \(S\) into \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Critical points of \(E\) include conformal
                    parameterisations of constant mean curvature surfaces in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). The functional itself is
                    unbounded from above
                    and below on \(H^1(S,\mathbb{R}^3)\), but all critical points have \(H\)-energy \(E\) at least
                    \(4\pi/3\), with
                    equality attained if and only if we are parametrising a round sphere (so \(S\) itself must be a
                    sphere) - this is the
                    classical isoperimetric inequality.
                    <br>
                    Here we will address the simple question: can one approach the natural lower energy bound by
                    critical points along fixed surfaces of higher genus? In fact we prove more subtle quantitative
                    estimates for any (almost-)critical point whose energy is close to \(4\pi/3\). Standard theory tells
                    us that a sequence of (almost-)critical points on a fixed torus \(T\), whose energy approaches
                    \(4\pi/3\), must bubble-converge to a sphere: there is a shrinking disc on the torus that gets
                    mapped to a larger and larger region of the round sphere, and away from the disc our maps converge
                    to a constant. Thus the limiting object is really a map from a sphere to \(\mathbb{R}^3\), and the
                    challenge is to
                    compare maps from a torus with the limiting map (i.e. a change of topology in the limit). In
                    particular we can prove a gap theorem for the lowest energy level on a fixed surface and estimate
                    the rates at which bubbling maps u are becoming spherical in terms of the size of \(dE[u]\) - these
                    are commonly referred to as Łojasiewicz-type estimates.

                    A hyperbolic surface is a surface with metric of constant curvature \(-1\). The spectral gap between
                    the
                    first two eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a closed hyperbolic surface contains a good deal of
                    information about the surface, including its connectivity, dynamical properties of its geodesic
                    flow, and error terms in geodesic counting problems. For arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces the spectral
                    gap is also the subject of one of the biggest open problems in automorphic forms: Selberg's
                    eigenvalue conjecture.
                    <br>
                    It was an open problem from the 1970s whether there exist a sequence of closed hyperbolic surfaces
                    with genera tending to infinity and spectral gap tending to \(1/4\). (The value \(1/4\) here is the
                    asymptotically optimal one.) Recently we proved that this is indeed possible. I'll discuss the very
                    interesting background of this problem in detail as well as some ideas of the proof.

                    Nodal sets of Steklov eigenfunctions on manifolds with boundary have been extensively studied in
                    recent years. Somewhat less well understood are the nodal sets of their restrictions to the
                    boundary, that is, the eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. In particular, little is
                    known about nodal counts. In this talk we explore this problem and prove an asymptotic version of
                    Courant's nodal domain theorem for Dirichlet-to-Neumann eigenfunctions.

                    On a closed negatively curved surface, Margulis gave the asymptotic growth of the number of closed
                    geodesics of bounded length, when the bound goes to infinity. In this talk, I will present a similar
                    asymptotic result for closed geodesics for which certain intersection numbers — with a given family
                    of pairwise disjoint simple closed geodesics — are prescribed. This result is obtained by
                    introducing a dynamical scattering operator related to the surface (with boundary) obtained by
                    cutting our original surface along the simple curves, and by proving a trace formula.
