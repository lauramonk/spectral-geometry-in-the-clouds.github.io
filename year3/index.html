                    Direct generalizations of Courant's celebrated nodal domain theorem are often false. A notable
                    example is the case of linear combinations of eigenfunctions in dimension 2 or more, known as the
                    "Courant-Herrmann conjecture".
                    <br>
                    It turns out that a bound which is consistent with Courant's theorem and Weyl's law remains true in
                    this case if we ignore nodal domains where the function is small. It also extends in the following
                    sought-after directions: to elliptic operators acting on sections of vector bundles, to higher Betti
                    numbers of nodal domains, and to products of linear combinations of eigenfunctions. In particular,
                    we obtain a coarse version of Bézout's theorem for eigenfunctions.
                    <br>
                    Our methods combine new results about persistence modules, a notion originating in topological data
                    analysis, and multiscale polynomial approximation in Sobolev spaces.

                    In 1977, Berry conjectured that eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on manifolds of negative curvature
                    behave, in the high-energy (or semiclassical) limit, as a random superposition of plane waves. This
                    conjecture, central in quantum chaos, is still completely open.
                    <br>
                    In this talk, we will consider a much simpler situation. On a manifold of negative curvature, we
                    will consider a Lagrangian state associated to a generic phase. We show that, when evolved during a
                    long time by the Schrödinger equation, these functions do behave, in the semiclassical limit, as a
                    random superposition of plane waves.
                    <br>
                    This talk is based on joint work with Alejandro Rivera, and on work in progress with Martin Vogel.

                Ruelle zeta at zero for nearly hyperbolic 3-manifolds

                    For a compact negatively curved Riemannian manifold \((\Sigma,g)\), the Ruelle zeta function
                    \(\zeta_{\mathrm R}(\lambda)\) of its geodesic flow is defined for \(\Re\lambda\gg 1\) as a
                    convergent
                    product over the periods \(T_{\gamma}\) of primitive closed geodesics
                    \(\zeta_{\mathrm R}(\lambda)=\prod_\gamma(1-e^{-\lambda T_{\gamma}})\)
                    and extends meromorphically to the entire complex plane. If \(\Sigma\) is hyperbolic (i.e. has
                    sectional curvature \(-1\)), then the order of vanishing \(m_{\mathrm R}(0)\) of \(\zeta_{\mathrm
                    R}\) at
                    \(\lambda=0\) can be expressed in terms of the Betti numbers \(b_j(\Sigma)\). In particular, Fried
                    proved in 1986 that when \(\Sigma\) is a hyperbolic 3-manifold,
                    \(m_{\mathrm R}(0)=4-2b_1(\Sigma)\).
                    I will present a recent result joint with Mihajlo Cekić, Benjamin Küster, and Gabriel Paternain:
                    when \(\dim\Sigma=3\) and \(g\) is a generic perturbation of the hyperbolic metric, the order of
                    vanishing of the Ruelle zeta function jumps, more precisely
                    \(m_{\mathrm R}(0)=4-b_1(\Sigma)\).
                    This is in contrast with dimension 2 where \(m_{\mathrm R}(0)=b_1(\Sigma)-2\) for all negatively
                    curved metrics. The proof uses the microlocal approach of expressing \(m_{\mathrm R}(0)\) as an
                    alternating sum of the dimensions of the spaces of generalized resonant Pollicott—Ruelle currents
                    and obtains a detailed picture of these spaces both in the hyperbolic case and for its
                    perturbations.

                    The Cheeger constant of a Riemannian manifold measures how hard it is to cut out a large part of the
                    manifold. If the Cheeger constant of a manifold is large, then, through Cheeger's inequality, this
                    implies that Laplacian of the manifold has a large spectral gap. In this talk, I will discuss how
                    large Cheeger constants of hyperbolic surfaces can be. In particular, I will discuss recent joint
                    work with Thomas Budzinski and Nicolas Curien in which we prove that the Cheeger constant of a
                    closed hyperbolic surface of large genus cannot be much larger than \(2/\pi\) (approximately
                    \(0.6366\)).
                    This in particular proves that there is a uniform gap between the maximal possible Cheeger constant
                    of a hyperbolic surface of large enough genus and the Cheeger constant of the hyperbolic plane
                    (which is equal to \(1\)).

                Quantum ergodicity for periodic graphs

                    Quantum ergodicity for graphs is a delocalization result which says the following. Suppose that a
                    sequence of finite graphs \(\Gamma_N\) converges to some infinite graph \(\Gamma\). Then <i>most</i>
                    eigenfunctions \(\psi_j^{(N)}\) of the adjacency matrix \(\mathcal{A}_N\) on \(\Gamma_N\) become
                    equidistributed on \(\Gamma_N\) when \(N\) gets large. More precisely, for most \(j\), the
                    probability
                    measure \(\sum_{v\in \Gamma_N} |\psi_j^{(N)}(v)|^2 \delta_v\) approaches the uniform measure
                    \(\frac{1}{|\Gamma_N|}\sum_{v\in \Gamma_N} \delta_v\), in a weak sense. Potentials \(Q\) can
                    sometimes
                    be added, so that one now considers the eigenfunctions of \(H_N = \mathcal{A}_N+Q_N\). Usually, the
                    proof partially relies on certain nice properties of the infinite graph \(\Gamma\). In particular,
                    quantum ergodicity theorems have previously been established when \(\Gamma\) is a tree.
                    <br>
                    In this talk, I will present recent results of quantum ergodicity when \(\Gamma\) is invariant under
                    translations of some basis of \(\mathbb{Z}^d\), and the "fundamental block" is endowed a potential
                    \(Q\)
                    which is copied across the blocks, so that \(H = \mathcal{A}_\Gamma+Q\) is a periodic Schrödinger
                    operator. This framework includes \(\Gamma=\mathbb{Z}^d\), the honeycomb lattice, strips, cylinders,
                    etc.
                    <br>
                    I will first discuss the Bloch theorem and give some examples of its limitations, presenting along
                    the way some very homogeneous graphs which violate quantum ergodicity. I will then discuss our main
                    results, contrasting them with the tree case, give various examples of applications, and sketch the
                    proof. An open problem concerning Schrödinger operators with a periodic potential on
                    \(\mathbb{Z}^d\), \(d>1\), will also be presented.
                    <br>
                    This talk is based on a joint work with Theo McKenzie (Harvard).

                    In this talk, I shall present a recent paper with Frank Rösler in which we consider the
                    computability and non-computability of eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on bounded domains
                    with rough, possibly fractal, boundaries.
                    This problem may be formulated rigorously within the recently introduced framework of Solvability
                    Complexity Indices.
                    In our pursuit to address this question, we are led to the development of new spectral convergence
                    results for the Dirichlet Laplacian on rough domains, as well as a novel Poincaré-type inequality,
                    which shall be the main focus of my talk.

                    In this talk, we will present the twisted Ruelle zeta function, associated with representations that
                    are not necessarily unitary, and how its special value at zero is related to the complex-valued
                    analytic torsion. The relation between the twisted Ruelle zeta function and spectral (or
                    topological) invariants is the so called Fried's conjecture. In addition, we will present results
                    that are related to the Fried's conjecture for hyperbolic surfaces and orbisurfaces. If time allows,
                    we will present some recent results concerning the investigation of the spectrum of the twisted
                    Laplacians, as the representation varies in a suitable Teichmueller space.

                    Resonances of Riemannian manifolds are often studied with
                    tools of microlocal analysis. I will discuss some recent results on
                    upper fractal Weyl bounds for certain hyperbolic surfaces of infinite
                    area, obtained with transfer operator techniques, which are tools
                    complementary to microlocal analysis. This is joint work with F. Naud
                    and L. Soares.

                    On this talk I will first talk about the isospectral problem in geometry and about isospectrality of
                    Strum-Liouville operators on a finite interval in the simplify form of a Schrödinger operator. I
                    will mention very interesting known results about isospectral potentials. I will introduce
                    quasi-isospectrality as a generalization of isospectrality, and will present what we know so far
                    about quasi-isospectral potentials. The work presented here is still on-going joint work with Camilo
                    Perez.

                Maximization of Neumann eigenvalues under diameter

                    In this talk we study the maximization problem of the Neumann eigenvalues under diameter
                    constraint. We start by presenting a sequence of domains \(\Omega_\epsilon\)
                    for which \(D(\Omega_\epsilon)^2 \mu_1(\Omega_\epsilon)\) goes to
                    infinity.
                    <br>
                    We then define the profile function \(f\) associated to a domain \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d\),
                    assuming that this function
                    is \(\beta\)-concave, with \(0 < \beta \leq 1\), we will give sharp upper bounds of the quantity
                        \(D(\Omega)^2 \mu_k (\Omega)\) in terms of \(β\). The bounds will go to infinity when \(\beta\)
                        goes to zero. This will also give a new proof of a result by Kröger, namely sharp upper bounds
                        for \(D(\Omega)^2 \mu_k (\Omega)\) when \(\Omega\) is convex (that correspond to \(\beta=(d -
                        1)^{-1}\)). The proof of this results are based on a maximization problem for relaxed
                        Sturm-Liouville eigenvalues. <br>
                        This talk is based on a joint work with Antoine Henrot.

                    In this talk we will explain how the "number variance" for the twisted laplace spectrum of compact
                    hyperbolic surfaces
                    can be investigated using the model of random covers. In the large degree regime we recover, in a
                    probabilistic sense,
                    the variance of GOE/GUE models depending on the twist behaviour and the time symmetry invariance.
                    Generalizations to Laplace
                    operators acting on flat vector bundles will be also mentioned.

                    fourth-order Paneitz operator in conformal geometry. We study the corresponding eigenvalue problems,
                    showing, in particular, a bifurcation phenomenon in annular domains.

                    Furstenberg Theorem on unique ergodicity of horocycle flow over compact hyperbolic surfaces can be
                    passed through a semiclassical quantization. We then arrive to a plenty of <i>horocycle
                        eigenfunctions</i> \(u\) defined at the hyperbolic plane \(\mathbb{C}^+\). They enjoy
                    \(
                    \left(-y^2\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\right)+ 2i\tau
                    y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)u(x+iy)=s^2 u(x+iy)\), \(x+iy\in\mathbb{C}^+\),
                    with \(\tau\to\infty\), \(s=o(\tau)\), \(s,\tau\in\mathbb{R}\), and possess Quantum Unique
                    Ergodicity
                    (\(\hbar=1/\tau\)). At the left-hand side, we recognize <i>magnetic</i> Hamiltonian at hyperbolic
                    plane.
                    <br>
                    Such functions can be analytically continued to a neighborhood of \(\mathbb{C}^+\) in its
                    complexification.
                    The latter is just \(\{(X,Y)\colon X, Y\in\mathbb{C}\}\). We establish asymptotic estimates for
                    the
                    growth of these continuations as \(\tau\to\infty\), and for de Rham currents given by their
                    divisors.
                    <br>
                    The main feature making this setting different from that of free quantum particle (and geodesic
                    flow) is presence of <i>gauge factors</i> in calculations and in answers.

                    In 1954, G. Pólya conjectured that the estimate
                    \(N_{\mathcal{D}}(\Omega, \Lambda) \leq C_W \Lambda^{d/2}\)
                    holds true for all \(\Lambda\) > 0. Here \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) is a bounded domain,
                    \(\Lambda\) is the spectral parameter,
                    \(N_{\mathcal{D}}(\Omega, \Lambda)\) is the counting function of the Laplace operator of the
                    Dirichlet problem in \(\Omega\), and \(C_W\)
                    is the constant in the Weyl law. We prove this conjecture for the balls of arbitrary dimension.

                    This talk is devoted to the characterization of the essential spectrum of three-dimensional Dirac
                    operators with critical combinations of electrostatic and Lorentz scalar shell interactions
                    supported on a smooth compact surface.
                    <br>
                    After giving the rigorous definition and basic spectral properties of the perturbed operator, we
                    show that its essential spectrum within the gap of the free Dirac operator is nonempty and depends
                    on the surface geometry. More precisely, we show that the criticality of the interaction leads to a
                    new interval of the essential spectrum whose position and length are explicitly controlled by the
                    coupling constants and the principal curvatures of the surface, reducing to a single point only in
                    the case of a sphere.

                    Problems of optimisation of eigenvalues (or combination of eigenvalues) associated to an operator
                    (Laplacian, Dirichlet-to-Neumann, etc) depending on a Riemannian metric on a differentiable manifold
                    are often addressed in spectral geometry. For instance, they made it possible to build new minimal
                    surfaces in the past decade. It is about finding the optimal bounds which depend on geometric and
                    topologic data of the manifold and - when they are realized - extremal metrics.
                    <br>
                    We will explain a new variational method on functionals depending on eigenvalues. The classical
                    methods do not work because these functionals are not \(C^1\) at metrics which have eigenvalues with
                    multiplicity bigger than 2 involved in the functional. We will then use in this context a
                    subdifferential which provides the generalization of classical notions of gradient, critical points
                    and Palais-Smale sequences.
                    <br>
                    As an application, we will explain how this new approach simplifies and unifies previous
                    optimization results in dimension 2 and generalizes them in dimension higher than 3.

                    I will discuss a recent construction (with N. Kapouleas) for immersed free boundary minimal annuli
                    in the unit 3-ball. These surfaces are constructed using singular perturbation PDE methods by
                    "doubling" an equatorial half-disk, and have arbitrarily small first Steklov eigenvalue.

                    and spectral invariants associated with closed hyperbolic surfaces, both in low and high genus. The
                    proofs are based on finding good test functions to use in the Selberg trace formula (a strategy
                    heavily inspired by work of Cohn and Elkies on the density of Euclidean sphere packings).

                    The first non-zero Laplace eigenvalue of a hyperbolic surface, or its spectral gap, measures how
                    well-connected the surface is: surfaces with a large spectral gap are hard to cut in pieces, have a
                    small diameter and fast mixing times. For large hyperbolic surfaces (of large area or large genus
                    \(g\), equivalently), we know that the spectral gap is bounded above by \(1/4 + o_g(1)\).
                    <br>
                    The aim of this talk is to present recent progress in my project with Nalini Anantharaman, where we
                    aim to prove that most hyperbolic surfaces have a near-optimal spectral gap, i.e. for all
                    \(\epsilon >0\), the limit of \(\mathbb{P}_g \left(\lambda_1 \geq \frac
                    14 - \epsilon \right)\) as \(g\) goes to infinity is equal to \(1\).
                    Here, \(\mathbb{P}_g\) denotes the Weil--Petersson probability measure on the moduli space of
                    compact
                    hyperbolic surfaces of genus \(g\). This statement is analogous to Alon's 1986 conjecture for
                    regular
                    graphs, proven by Friedman in 2003.
                    <br>
                    I will present our approach, which is based on the trace method and shares many similarities with
                    Friedman's work. I will explain some of the challenges that are encountered, and introduce new tools
                    that we have developed in order to tackle them. So far, our methods allow us to obtain a spectral
                    gap \(2/9 - \epsilon\), hence improving on the bound \(3/16 - \epsilon\) obtained by Wu—Xue and
                    Lipnowski—Wright in 2021. To conclude the talk, we will discuss the final steps that need to be
                    taken to obtain the optimal result.

                    We discuss the typical behavior of two important quantities on compact manifolds with a Riemannian
                    metric \(g\): the number, \(c(T, g)\), of primitive closed geodesics of length smaller than \(T\),
                    and the
                    error, \(E(L, g)\), in the Weyl law for counting the number of Laplace eigenvalues that are smaller
                    than \(L\). For Baire generic metrics, the qualitative behavior of both of these quantities has been
                    understood since the 1970's and 1980's. In terms of quantitative behavior, the only available result
                    is due to Contreras and it says that an exponential lower bound on \(c(T, g)\) holds for \(g\) in a
                    Baire-generic set. Until now, no upper bounds on \(c(T, g)\) or quantitative improvements on \(E(L,
                    g)\)
                    were known to hold for most metrics, not even for a dense set of metrics. In this talk, we will
                    introduce the concept of predominance in the space of Riemannian metrics. This is a notion that is
                    analogous to having full Lebesgue measure in finite dimensions, and which, in particular, implies
                    density. We will then give stretched exponential upper bounds for \(c(T, g)\) and logarithmic
                    improvements for \(E(L, g)\) that hold for a predominant set of metrics. This is based on joint work
                    with J. Galkowski.

                    We consider the first eigenvalue of the fractional Dirichlet-Laplacian
                    \((-\Delta)^s\) and we show a lower bound in terms of the inradius of the set for certain
                    values of \(s\). In particular, we prove such an estimate for the class of planar
                    sets with a fixed number \(k\) of “holes”. We also discuss the optimality (in some
                    sense) of its dependence with respect to the parameters \(s\) and \(k\).
                    Some of the results presented are obtained in collaboration with Lorenzo
                    Brasco (University of Ferrara).

                    In this talk, we consider the asymptotic properties of certain spectral cluster kernels on a
                    smooth, compact Riemannian manifold \((M, g)\) without boundary. Let \(\Delta_g\) denote the
                    positive
                    Laplace-Beltrami operator on \(M\), which has discrete spectrum
                    \(\{\lambda_j^2\}_{j=0}^\infty \subset \mathbb{R}\). We study the
                    Schwartz kernel of the orthogonal projection operator
                    \(\Pi_{I_\lambda} : L^2(M) \rightarrow \bigoplus_{\lambda_j \in I_\lambda} \mathrm{ker}(\Delta_g +
                    \lambda_j^2)\)
                    where \(I_\lambda\) is an interval centered around \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\) of a small, fixed
                    length. It is conjectured that
                    on any manifold, \(\Pi_{I_\lambda}(x,y)\) has universal asymptotic behavior in a shrinking
                    neighborhood of
                    the diagonal as \(\lambda \rightarrow \infty\), provided that the interval \(I_\lambda\) is chosen
                    to contain sufficiently many
                    eigenvalues. Such asymptotics then imply that certain statistical properties of monochromatic random
                    waves have universal behavior. The conjecture is known to hold for the
                    round sphere and the flat torus, and also under general geometric assumptions which yield
                    a remainder improvement in the off-diagonal Weyl law. In particular, Canzani and Hanin
                    showed that the conjecture holds near non-self focal points. In this talk, we show that in
                    the opposite case of Zoll manifolds, where all geodesics are periodic with the same period,
                    one can still demonstrate universal asymptotic behavior for an appropriate choice of cluster
                    intervals \(I_\lambda\).

                    It is a classical question to study the way the (Laplace) spectrum of a geometric
                    object behaves as the latter degenerates. Depending on the nature of the problem
                    one is led to use either singular or analytic perturbation theory. I will present
                    the basic difference between these two approaches and several well-known or more
                    recent results. I will in particular emphasize the relation between these questions
                    and (semiclassical) concentration properties and present applications to spectral
                    simplicity of simple shapes. Most of this talk will be based on joint work with C.

                    We will discuss Schrödinger operators on graphs generated by aperiodic tilings. For several
                    elements in the MLD class of the Penrose tiling, one finds eigenfunctions whose support is contained
                    in a finite set of tiles. The presence of such eigenfunctions was known for the rhombic Penrose
                    tiling since the work of Kohmoto—Sutherland in the 1980s. These eigenfunctions produce a
                    discontinuity in the integrated density of states at the corresponding energy by linear
                    repetitivity, and therefore the size of the discontinuity can then be estimated from below by the
                    patch frequency corresponding to the support of the eigenfunction in question. [joint work with D.

                    Spectral inequalities are a crucial ingredient in control theory to obtain controllability
                    properties of certain inhomogeneous parabolic systems. In this talk we will show how a result from
                    complex analysis, the Logvinenko-Sereda Theorem, has become a popular tool to obtain spectral
                    inequalities and we will give a general framework which streamline its proof. This talk is based on
