                    We initiate an approach to simultaneously treat numerators and denominators of Green's functions
                    arising from quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators, which in particular allows us to study
                    completely resonant phases of the almost Mathieu operator.
                    <br>
                    Let \((H_{\lambda,\alpha,\theta}u) (n)=u(n+1)+u(n-1)+ 2\lambda \cos2\pi(\theta+n\alpha)u(n)\) be
                    the almost Mathieu operator on \(\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})\), where \(\lambda, \alpha, \theta\in
                    \mathbb{R}\).
                    Let \( \beta(\alpha)=\limsup_{k\rightarrow \infty}-\frac{\ln
                    ||k\alpha||_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}}{|k|}\).
                    We prove that for any \(\theta\) with \(2\theta\in \alpha \mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}\),
                    \(H_{\lambda,\alpha,\theta}\)
                    satisfies Anderson localization if \(|\lambda|>e^{2\beta(\alpha)}\).

                    The spectral theory of the Laplace operator on graphs offers many analogies with that of Riemannian
                    manifolds, like Cheeger type inequalities, but also shows some different phenomena.
                    For hypergraphs, a main step consists in the definition of a Laplace operator that can also offer
                    such analogies.
                    Lovasz extensions of Rayleigh quotients can uncover some deeper reasons behind such analogies.

                Quantum ergodicity for expanding quantum graphs in the regime of spectral delocalization

                    The aim of the talk is to discuss the phenomenon of "quantum ergodicity" of eigenfunctions on large
                    expander graphs. We will start with the work of Anantharaman-Le Masson and Anantharaman-Sabri
                    concerning discrete graphs, but the goal is to prove similar results for large quantum graphs. Last
                    year, we proved the same statement for quantum graphs that had been obtained for discrete graphs :
                    if a sequence of finite quantum expander graphs "converges" to an infinite tree, and the latter has
                    purely absolutely continuous spectrum in some given interval \(I\), then "most" of the
                    eigenfunctions of
                    the finite graphs with frequency in \(I\) are delocalized in the sense of quantum ergodicity (which
                    is a
                    rather weak notion of delocalization). Note that the size of the graph goes to infinity, not the
                    frequency, and that we are now dealing with unbounded Schrödinger operators, which modifies a lot
                    the arguments, although the phenomenon is the same at the end. This is joint work with M. Ingremeau,
                    M. Sabri, B. Winn. After stating the result, the talk will mostly be dedicated to the definition of
                    Benjamini-Schramm convergence (which is new for quantum graphs) and to examples where the result
                    applies.

                    In this talk I will show that the Morse index of the critical Moebius band in the 4-dimensional
                    Euclidean ball equals 5. This result makes use of the quartic Hopf differential technique and a
                    comparison theorem between the index of a free boundary minimal surface in the Euclidean ball and
                    its spectral index. The latter also enables us to reprove a well-known result that the index of the
                    critical catenoid in the 3-ball equals 4. These results are obtained in my paper in progress.

                    In this talk we present a comparison between the normalized first (non-trivial) Neumann eigenvalue
                    \(|\Omega| \mu_1(\Omega)\) for a Lipschitz open set \(\Omega\) in the plane, and the normalized
                    first (non-trivial)
                    Steklov
                    eigenvalue \(P(\Omega) \sigma_1 (\Omega)\).
                    More precisely, we study the ratio \(F (\Omega) := |\Omega| \mu_1 (\Omega)/P (\Omega)
                    \sigma_1(\Omega)\). We prove that this ratio can
                    take arbitrarily small or large values if we do not put any restriction on the class of sets
                    \(\Omega\). Then
                    we restrict ourselves to the class of plane convex domains for which we get explicit bounds. We
                    also study the case of thin convex domains for which we give more precise bounds.
                    In the last part of the talk we present the corresponding Blaschke-Santaló diagrams \((x, y) =
                    (|\Omega|\mu_1 (\Omega), P (\Omega) \sigma_1 (\Omega))\) and we state some open problems.
                    This talk is based on a joint work with Antoine Henrot.

                    surfaces, focusing on the size of the first non-zero eigenvalue i.e. the spectral gap. We shall
                    introduce
                    a model for random surfaces, arising from the Weil-Petersson metric on moduli space. Then we shall

                    The spectral theory of non-selfadjoint operators is an old and highly developed subject. Yet it
                    still poses
                    many new challenges crucial for the understanding of modern problems such as scattering systems,
                    open or damped quantum systems, the analysis of the stability of solutions to non-linear PDEs, and
                    many more. The lack of powerful tools readily available for their selfadjoint counterparts, such a
                    general
                    spectral theorem or variational methods, makes the analysis of the spectra of non-selfadjoint
                    operators
                    a subtle and highly varied subject.
                    One fundamental issue of non-selfadjoint operators is their intrinsic sensitivity to perturbations,
                    indeed
                    even small perturbations can change the spectrum dramatically. This spectral instability, also
                    called
                    pseudospectral effect, was initially considered a drawback as it can be at the origin of severe
                    numerical
                    errors. However, recent works in semiclassical analysis and random matrix theory have shown that
                    this
                    pseudospectral effect also leads to new and beautiful results concerning the spectral distribution
                    and
                    eigenvector localization of non-selfadjoint operators with small random perturbations.
                    In this talk, I will discuss recent results and some fundamental techniques involved in the
                    analysis.
                    The talk is partly based on joint work with Anirban Basak, Stéphane Nonnenmacher, Johannes
                    Sjöstrand and Ofer Zeitouni.

                    On a compact surface of variable negative curvature, I will explain that
                    the Poincaré series associated to the geodesic arcs joining two given
                    points has a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane. This
                    is achieved by using the spectral properties of the geodesic flow.
                    Moreover, the value of Poincaré series value at 0 is rationnal in that
                    case and it can be expressed in terms of the genus of the surface by
                    interpreting it in terms of the linking of two Legendrian knots. If time
                    permits, I will explain how this result extends when one considers
                    geodesic arcs orthogonal to two fixed closed geodesics. This is a joint
                    work with N.V. Dang.

                    We will discuss some recent results regarding the number of nodal domains of Laplace and
                    Schrödinger operators. Improving on Courant's seminal work, Pleijel's original proof in 1956 was
                    only for domains in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with Dirichlet boundary conditions, but it was later
                    generalized
                    to manifolds (Peetre and Bérard-Meyer) with Dirichlet boundary conditions, then to planar domains
                    with Neumann Boundary conditions (Polterovich, Léna), but also to the quantum harmonic oscillator
                    (C.) and to Schrödinger operators with radial potentials (C. - Helffer - Hoffmann-Ostenhof). In
                    this recent work, we proved Pleijel's asymptotic upper bound for a much larger class of
                    Schrödinger operators which are not necessarily radial. In this talk, I will explain the problems
                    that arise from studying Schrödinger operators as well as the successive improvements in the
                    methods that led to the current results.

                    Just over a decade ago, Fraser and Schoen initiated the study of metrics maximizing the first
                    Steklov eigenvalue among all metrics of fixed boundary length on a given surface with boundary.
                    Drawing inspiration from the maximization problem for Laplace eigenvalues on closed surfaces--where
                    maximizing metrics are induced by minimal immersions into spheres — they showed that
                    Steklov-maximizing metrics are induced by free boundary minimal immersions into Euclidean balls, and
                    laid the groundwork for an existence theory (recently completed by important work of
                    Matthiesen-Petrides). In this talk, I'll describe joint work with Mikhail Karpukhin, characterizing
                    the limiting behavior of these metrics on surfaces of fixed genus \(g\) and \(k\) boundary
                    components as \(k\)
                    becomes large. In particular, I'll explain why the associated free boundary minimal surfaces
                    converge to the closed minimal surface of genus \(g\) in the sphere given by maximizing the first
                    Laplace eigenvalue, with areas converging at a rate of \((\log k)/k\).

                    The Berry Tabor conjecture predicts that the local statistics of eigenvalues of a regular system is
                    Poissonian, at least in generic cases. In this talk, I consider the special case of flat tori which
                    has the attractive feature that arithmetic tools become available. I will explain some ideas and
                    methods from analytic number theory that shed light on this question, in particular with respect to
                    small gaps, large gaps and triple correlation. This covers joint papers with Aistleitner, Bourgain,

                    It is a conjecture going back to J. Rauch (1974) that the hottest and coldest spots in an insulated
                    homogeneous medium such as an insulated
                    plate of metal should converge to the boundary, for "most" initial heat distributions, as time tends
                    to infinity. This so-called hot spots conjecture can be phrased alternatively as follows: the
                    eigenfunction(s) corresponding to the first non-zero eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian
                    on a Euclidean domain should take its maximum and minimum on the boundary only. This has been proven
                    to be false for certain domains with
                    holes, but it was shown to hold for several classes of simply connected or convex planar domains.
                    One of the most recent advances is the proof for all triangles given by Judge and Mondal (Annals of
                    Math. 2020). The conjecture remains open in general for simply connected or at least convex domains.
                    In this talk we provide a new approach to the conjecture. It is based on a non-standard variational
                    principle for the eigenvalues of the Neumann and Dirichlet Laplacians.

                    In this talk I shall present constructions of Schrödinger operators with complex-valued potentials
                    whose spectra exhibit interesting properties. One example shows that for sufficiently large \(p\),
                    namely \(p>(d+1)/2\) where \(d\) is the dimension, the discrete eigenvalues need not be bounded by
                    the
                    \(L^p\) norm of the potential. This is a counterexample to the Laptev—Safronov conjecture (Comm.
                    Math. Phys. 2009).
                    Another construction proves optimality (in some sense) of generalisations of Lieb—Thirring
                    inequalities to the non-selfadjoint case - thus giving us information about the accumulation rate of
                    the discrete eigenvalues to the essential spectrum.

                    The \(H\)-functional \(E\) is a natural variant of the Dirichlet energy along maps \(u\) from a
                    closed surface \(S\) into \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Critical points of \(E\) include conformal
                    parameterisations of constant mean curvature surfaces in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). The functional itself is
                    unbounded from above
                    and below on \(H^1(S,\mathbb{R}^3)\), but all critical points have \(H\)-energy \(E\) at least
                    \(4\pi/3\), with
                    equality attained if and only if we are parametrising a round sphere (so \(S\) itself must be a
                    sphere) - this is the
                    classical isoperimetric inequality.
                    <br>
                    Here we will address the simple question: can one approach the natural lower energy bound by
                    critical points along fixed surfaces of higher genus? In fact we prove more subtle quantitative
                    estimates for any (almost-)critical point whose energy is close to \(4\pi/3\). Standard theory tells
                    us that a sequence of (almost-)critical points on a fixed torus \(T\), whose energy approaches
                    \(4\pi/3\), must bubble-converge to a sphere: there is a shrinking disc on the torus that gets
                    mapped to a larger and larger region of the round sphere, and away from the disc our maps converge
                    to a constant. Thus the limiting object is really a map from a sphere to \(\mathbb{R}^3\), and the
                    challenge is to
                    compare maps from a torus with the limiting map (i.e. a change of topology in the limit). In
                    particular we can prove a gap theorem for the lowest energy level on a fixed surface and estimate
                    the rates at which bubbling maps u are becoming spherical in terms of the size of \(dE[u]\) - these
                    are commonly referred to as Łojasiewicz-type estimates.

                    A hyperbolic surface is a surface with metric of constant curvature \(-1\). The spectral gap between
                    the
                    first two eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a closed hyperbolic surface contains a good deal of
                    information about the surface, including its connectivity, dynamical properties of its geodesic
                    flow, and error terms in geodesic counting problems. For arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces the spectral
                    gap is also the subject of one of the biggest open problems in automorphic forms: Selberg's
                    eigenvalue conjecture.
                    <br>
                    It was an open problem from the 1970s whether there exist a sequence of closed hyperbolic surfaces
                    with genera tending to infinity and spectral gap tending to \(1/4\). (The value \(1/4\) here is the
                    asymptotically optimal one.) Recently we proved that this is indeed possible. I'll discuss the very
                    interesting background of this problem in detail as well as some ideas of the proof.

                    Nodal sets of Steklov eigenfunctions on manifolds with boundary have been extensively studied in
                    recent years. Somewhat less well understood are the nodal sets of their restrictions to the
                    boundary, that is, the eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. In particular, little is
                    known about nodal counts. In this talk we explore this problem and prove an asymptotic version of
                    Courant's nodal domain theorem for Dirichlet-to-Neumann eigenfunctions.

                    On a closed negatively curved surface, Margulis gave the asymptotic growth of the number of closed
                    geodesics of bounded length, when the bound goes to infinity. In this talk, I will present a similar
                    asymptotic result for closed geodesics for which certain intersection numbers — with a given family
                    of pairwise disjoint simple closed geodesics — are prescribed. This result is obtained by
                    introducing a dynamical scattering operator related to the surface (with boundary) obtained by
                    cutting our original surface along the simple curves, and by proving a trace formula.

                    In this talk, I will discuss recent progress on a class of "tricky" problems concerning additive
                    properties of integral points belonging to the circles.
                    I will focus on spectral applications testing M. Berry's ansatz on nodal deficiency in presence of
                    boundary. The square billiard is studied, where the high spectral degeneracies allow for the
                    introduction of a Gaussian ensemble of random Laplace eigenfunctions. I will discuss the asymptotic
                    analysis of the nodal length slightly above the Planck scale.

                    The question of optimizing an eigenvalue of a family of self-adjoint
                    operators that depends on a set of parameters arises in diverse areas
                    of mathematical physics. Among the particular motivations for this
                    talk are the Floquet-Bloch decomposition of the Schroedinger operator
                    on a periodic structure, nodal count statistics of eigenfunctions of
                    quantum graphs, and the minimal spectral partitions of domains and
                    graphs. In each of these problems one seeks to identify and/or count the
                    critical points of the eigenvalue with a given label (say, the third
                    lowest) over the parameter space which is often known and simple, such
                    as a torus.
                    <br>
                    Classical Morse theory is a set of tools connecting the number of
                    critical points of a smooth function on a manifold to the topological
                    invariants of this manifold. However, the eigenvalues are not smooth
                    due to presence of eigenvalue multiplicities or "diabolical points".
                    We rectify this problem for eigenvalues of generic families of
                    finite-dimensional operators. The correct "Morse indices" of the
                    problematic diabolical points turn out to be universal: they depend
                    only on the total multiplicity at the diabolical point and on the
                    relative position of the eigenvalue of interest in the eigenvalue
                    group.

                    We discuss isoperimetric inequalities for the magnetic Laplacian on a bounded domain \(\Omega\)
                    endowed with an Aharonov-Bohm potential \(A\) with pole at a fixed point \(x_0\in\Omega\). Since
                    \(A\) is
                    harmonic on \(\Omega\setminus\{x_0\}\), the magnetic field vanishes; the spectrum for the Neumann
                    condition (or for the Steklov problem) reduces to that of the usual non-magnetic Laplacian, but only
                    when the flux of the potential \(A\) around the pole is an integer. When the flux is not an integer
                    the lowest eigenvalue is actually positive, and the scope of the talk is to show how to generalize
                    the classical inequalities of Szëgo-Weinberger, Brock and Weinstock to the lowest eigenvalue of
                    this particular magnetic operator, the model domain being a disk with the pole at its center. We
                    consider more generally domains in the plane endowed with a rotationally invariant metric (which
                    include the spherical and the hyperbolic case).

                    Domain perturbation theory for the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on families of bounded,
                    Lipschitz domains of \(\mathbb{R}^N\) is nowadays a well-understood, yet complicated subject. For
                    the biharmonic operator, the situation is more involved, mainly
                    due to two additional hurdles: 1) intermediate and Neumann boundary conditions
                    are very sensitive to the variation of the curvature of the boundary; 2) standard
                    techniques, such as the separation of variables, are not available. <br>
                    After a review of the main results and counterexamples for the Laplace operator
                    and the biharmonic operator, I will focus on three specific singular perturbations
                    where spectral continuity fails: the dumbbell domain (Neumann b.c); a Lipschitz
                    domain, whose boundary is locally defined as the graph of a fast oscillating smooth
                    function (Intermediate b.c.); thin annuli in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) (Neumann b.c). <br>
                    A particularly striking result is the following. Let \(\Omega\) be a bounded domain in
                    \(\mathbb{R}^2\)
                    with smooth boundary \(\partial \Omega\), and let \(\omega_h\) be the set of points in \(\Omega\)
                    whose
                    distance from
                    the boundary is smaller than \(h\). Then the eigenvalues of the biharmonic operator
                    on \(\omega_h\) with Neumann boundary conditions do not converge to the eigenvalues of the
                    biharmonic operator on \(\partial\Omega\); in fact, they converge to the eigenvalues of a system
                    of differential equations on \(\partial\Omega\). <br>

                    The maximum multiplicity of the first positive eigenvalue \(\lambda_1\) of the Laplacian on
                    Riemannian
                    surfaces has been studied by several authors. Its value is known for surfaces of small complexity,
                    but its asymptotic rate of growth in terms of the complexity is unknown. In this talk, I will
                    discuss joint work with Bram Petri in which we prove that the multiplicity of \(\lambda_1\) is at
                    most
                    8 for closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus 3 and that this bound is achieved by the most symmetric
                    such surface, the Klein quartic. The proof of the upper bound splits into two parts depending on the
                    value of \(\lambda_1\). When \(\lambda_1\) is not too large, we combine ideas of Sévennec for
                    bounding
                    the multiplicity on arbitrary surfaces with the Faber-Krahn inequality. When \(\lambda_1\) is
                    relatively large, we prove bounds using the Selberg trace formula and rigorous numerical
                    calculations, a strategy adapted from the theory of sphere packings with many potential future
                    applications. As for the lower bound on the multiplicity at the Klein quartic, it uses both trace
                    formula techniques and representation theory.

                    Quantum chaos denotes the study of quantum systems whose associated classical dynamics is chaotic.
                    For instance, a central question is to study the high frequencies behavior of the eigenstates of the
                    Laplace-Beltrami operator on a negatively curved compact Riemannian manifold \(M\). In that case,
                    the
                    associated classical dynamics is the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of \(M\), which is
                    hyperbolic and hence chaotic. Quantum cat maps are a popular toy model for this problem, in which
                    the geodesic flow is replaced by a cat map, i.e. the action on the torus of a matrix with integer
                    coefficients.
                    <br>
                    In this talk, I will introduce quantum cat maps, and then discuss a result of delocalization for the
                    associated eigenstates. This result is deduced from a <i>fractal uncertainty principle</i>. Similar
                    statements have been obtained in the context of negatively curved surfaces by Dyatlov-Jin and
                    Dyatlov-Jin-Nonnenmacher, and the case of two-dimensional cat maps have been dealt with by Schwartz.
                    The novelty of our result is that we are sometimes able to bypass the restriction to low dimensions.
                    <br>
                    This is a joint work with Semyon Dyatlov.

                    In this talk I will present some recent results obtained in collaboration with A. Henrot and A.
                    Lemenant (both in Nancy, France), on the maximization of the first (non trivial) Neumann eigenvalue,
                    under perimeter constraint, in dimension 2. Without any further assumption, the problem is trivial,
                    since the supremum is \(+\infty\). On the other hand, restricting to the class of convex domains,
                    the
                    problem becomes interesting: the maximum exists, but neither its value nor the optimal shapes are
                    known. In 2009 R.S. Laugesen and B.A. Siudeja conjectured that the maximum among convex sets should
                    be attained at squares and equilateral triangles. We prove that the conjecture is true for convex
                    planar domains having two axes of symmetry.

                    In this talk we will consider the essential spectrum of the Laplacian on differential forms over
                    noncompact manifolds. We will see a brief overview of known results and discuss the main differences
                    between the function and form spectrum. One interesting problem in the area is finding sufficient
                    and general enough conditions on the manifold so that the essential spectrum on forms is a connected
                    set. We will see that over asymptotically flat manifolds this is the case. The proof involves the
                    study of the structure of the manifold at infinity via Cheeger-Fukaya-Gromov theory and
                    Cheeger-Colding theory, combined with a generalized Weyl criterion for the computation of the
                    spectrum. Finally, we present some recent results on the form spectrum of negatively curved
                    manifolds.

                    physics called the conformal bootstrap. An example of such a bound is that the first nonzero
                    eigenvalue, \(\lambda_1\), must be less than 3.8388977. This bound is almost saturated by the Bolza
                    surface, which is a genus-2 surface with \(\lambda_1 \approx 3.8388873\). Similarly, this approach
                    gives the bound \(\lambda_1 \leq 2.678483\) for closed hyperbolic surfaces of genera at least 3,
                    while
                    the Klein quartic is a genus-3 surface with \(\lambda_1 \approx 2.678\). These bounds were derived
                    using numerical optimisation methods without rigorous error estimates, but they can also be made
                    rigorous. I will discuss how to obtain these bounds, as well as some other applications of this
                    approach.

                    In the 70's Almgren noticed that for a harmonic real-valued function defined on a ball, its
                    \(L^2\)-norm over a sub-sphere will have an increasing logarithmic derivative with respect to the
                    radius of mentioned sphere. We examined similar integrals over a more general class of parameterized
                    surfaces by studying harmonic functions defined on compact subdomains of Riemannian manifolds. The
                    integrals over spheres are also generalized to level sets of a given function satisfying certain
                    conditions. If we consider the \(L^2\) norms over these level sets parametrized by a generalization
                    of
                    the radius, we again reproduce Almgren's convexity property. We will sketch the proof of this result
                    and illustrate the usefulness of the convexity result by examining some explicit parameterized
                    families of surfaces, e.g. geodesic spheres and ellipses.

                    Steklov extremal metrics on surfaces have been much studied due to their connection to free-boundary
                    minimal surfaces found by Fraser and Schoen. In this talk, I will present a characterization of
                    higher dimensional Steklov conformally extremal metrics, highlighting its similarities with the same
                    problem for Laplace eigenvalues. To this end, I will answer the question of which normalization to
                    use and show how the Steklov problem with boundary density appears natural in this context. This is
                    joint work with Mikhail Karpukhin.

                    If we partition a graph according to the positive and negative components
                    of an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix, the resulting connected
                    subcomponents are called nodal domains. Examining the structure of nodal
                    domains has been used for more than 150 years to deduce properties of
                    eigenfunctions. Dekel, Lee, and Linial observed that according to
                    simulations, most eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of random regular
                    graphs have many nodal domains, unlike dense Erdős-Rényi graphs. In this
                    talk, we show that for the most negative eigenvalues of the adjacency
                    matrix of a random regular graph, there is an almost linear number of nodal
                    domains. Joint work with Shirshendu Ganguly, Sidhanth Mohanty, and Nikhil

                    We study the homogenisation problem for elliptic operators of the form \(\mathcal A_\varepsilon =
                    -\nabla A^\varepsilon \nabla\) with high-contrast random coefficients \(A^\varepsilon\). In
                    particular,
                    we are interested in the behaviour of their spectra. We assume that on one of the components of the
                    composite the coefficients \(A^\varepsilon\) are "of order one", the complimentary ``soft" component
                    consists of randomly distributed inclusions, whose size and spacing are of order \(\varepsilon \ll
                    1\),
                    and the values of \(A^\varepsilon\) on the inclusions are of order \(\varepsilon^2\).
                    <br>
                    Our interest in high-contrast homogenisation problems is motivated by the band-gap structure of
                    their spectra. From an intuitive point of view this phenomenon can be explained by looking at the
                    ``soft'' inclusions as micro-resonators, which may dramatically amplify of completely block the
                    propagation of waves in the medium, depending on the frequency. From a mathematically rigorous
                    perspective, this was first analysed by Zhikov (2000, 2004) in the periodic setting.
                    <br>
                    Despite a vigorous activity in the field of periodic high-contrast homogenisation during the last
                    two decades, the stochastic (random) high-contrast setting was largely overlooked, perhaps due to
                    the technical challenges and and more complicated intuitive picture.
                    <br>
                    In this talk I will present our recent results for the stochastic high-contrast setting. First we
                    will look at the homogenised operator \(\mathcal{A}^{\rm hom}\) and describe its spectrum. Then I
                    will
                    give our main results on the convergence of the spectra of \(\mathcal A_\varepsilon\) and a
                    characterisation of the limit spectrum \(\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}{\rm Sp}(\mathcal{A}^{\rm hom} )\).
                    In
                    contrast with the periodic setting, in the stochastic case the spectrum of the homogenised operator
                    \({\rm Sp}(\mathcal{A}^{\rm hom} )\) is, in general, a proper subset of \(\lim_{\varepsilon\to
                    0}{\rm
                    Sp}(\mathcal{A}^{\rm hom} )\). We analyse the ``additional'' part of the spectrum - the difference
                    between \(\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}{\rm Sp}(\mathcal{A}^{\rm hom} )\) and \({\rm Sp}(\mathcal{A}^{\rm
                    hom} )\), and provide its {\it asymptotic} characterisation. Finally, I will touch upon the
                    localisation of defect modes in the gaps of the limiting spectrum \(\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}{\rm
                    Sp}(\mathcal{A}^{\rm hom} )\) and our current and future work.

                    I will explain two upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues of a compact Riemannian manifold with
                    boundary. The first is in terms of the extrinsic diameters of the boundary, its injectivity radius
                    and the volume of the manifold. By applying these bounds to cylinders over closed manifold, we
                    obtain new bounds for eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on closed manifolds, in the spirit of
                    Berger—Croke. The second involves the volume of the manifold and of its boundary, as well as
                    packing and volume growth constants of the boundary and its distortion. I will take time to give
                    examples in order to explain why the quantities appearing in the inequalities are necessary. This is
                    a joint work with Alexandre Girouard.

                    Weyl's law describes the distribution of eigenvalues as the spectral parameter goes to infinity. For
                    surfaces with smooth boundary, a superpolynomially precise Weyl law for the Steklov problem for the
                    Laplacian can be obtained via the theory of pseudodifferential operators on circles. Adapting those
                    methods, we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion (as well as spectral invariants) for the
                    eigenvalues of the Steklov problem associated with a Schrödinger operator*, and a remainder estimate
                    depending on the regularity when the boundary is not smooth but merely of class \(C^r\).**
                    <br>
                    When the boundary is merely Lipschitz, it is a well-known open problem to prove that the eigenvalues
                    still obey a Weyl law. Following the works of Suslina, and later Agranovich, we know that piecewise
                    \(C^1\) is sufficient to obtain such asymptotics. Using conformal techniques and through a
                    perturbation of the pseudodifferential results we can obtain a Weyl law for the Steklov problem not
                    only for domains with Lipschitz boundary, but also in more singular settings that include every
                    polynomial cusp that is slow enough to obtain a discrete Steklov spectrum.***
                    <br>
                    In this talk, I will describe the Weyl laws that we have obtained over the last few years, briefly
                    mention the ideas behind the proofs and, time permitting, talk about the directions we could go from
                    there.

                    minimizes the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplace operator. Despite its apparent simplicity,
                    this result has only been proved for triangles and quadrilaterals. In this work we show that the
                    proof of the conjecture can be reduced to finitely many certified numerical computations. Moreover,
                    the local minimality of the regular polygon is reduced to a single validated numerical computation.
                    <br>
                    The steps of the proof strategy include the analytic computation of the Hessian matrix of the first
                    eigenvalue, the stability of the Hessian with respect to vertex perturbations and analytic upper
                    bounds for the diameter of an optimal set. Explicit a priori error estimates are given for the
                    finite element computation of the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of the first eigenvalue
                    associated to the regular polygon.
                    <br>
                    Results presented are obtained in collaboration with Dorin Bucur.

                    Motivated by experiments of physicists, in particular Thierry Dauxois
                    (ENS-Lyon), we started this work with Laure Saint-Raymond.
                    Using a simplified linear model, we are able to give a precise
                    mathematical status to these attractors. Using Mourre theory and some
                    pseudo-differential calculus, we can
                    show that such attractors exist generically in 2D.

                    We discuss the maximization of the \(k\)-th eigenvalue of the Laplace operator with Neumann boundary
                    conditions among domains of \({\mathbb R}^N\) with prescribed measure. We relax the problem to the
                    class of (possibly degenerate) densities in \({\mathbb R}^N\) with prescribed mass and prove the
                    existence of an optimal density. For \(k=1,2\) the two problems are equivalent and the maximizers are
                    known to be one and two equal balls, respectively. For \(k \ge 3\) this question remains open, except
                    in one dimension of the space where we prove that the maximal densities correspond to a union of \(k\)
                    equal segments. This result provides sharp upper bounds for Sturm-Liouville eigenvalues and proves
                    the validity of the Pólya conjecture in the class of densities in \(\mathbb R\).
                    <br>
                    Based on the relaxed formulation, we provide numerical approximations of optimal densities for
                    \(k=1, \dots, 8\) in \({\mathbb R}^2\).
                    <br>
                    This is a joint work with E. Martinet and E. Oudet.
