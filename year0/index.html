                    I will present results of a recent preprint, joint with Stanislav Krymski,
                    Leonid Parnovski, Iosif Polterovich, and David Sher. For a generic
                    curvilinear polygon with angles less than pi, we prove that the asymptotics
                    of Steklov eigenvalues obtained previously in
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00645">arXiv:1908.06455</a>, determines,
                    in a constructive manner, the number of vertices, and the properly ordered
                    sequence of side lengths, as well as the angles of the polygon, up to a certain
                    equivalence relation. I will also present counterexamples to this statement if
                    the generic assumptions fail.

                    We will show an explicit expression for the lowest positive eigenvalue of
                    the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated to any homogeneous sphere (a sphere
                    endowed with a Riemannian metric such that the action of its isometry group
                    on it is transitive). The expression is in terms of the parameters defining the
                    homogeneous metric. As a consequence, we will show that the Laplace spectrum
                    distinguishes any metric among homogeneous spheres, and furthermore, we will
                    obtain some applications to the Yamabe problem. Part of these results is in
                    collaboration with Renato Bettiol and Paolo Piccione.

                    In the last years, the stability question of several classical spectral
                    inequalities has been raised in the vein of the result by Fusco, Maggi and
                    Pratelli (2008), which gives a sharp quantitative form of the isoperimetric
                    inequality. After an introduction to this topic, I will focus on some recent
                    results obtained with M. Nahon and A. Giacomini on spectral problems involving
                    boundary energies. Precisely, following a question raised by Girouard and Polterovich,
                    I will show that the Weinstock inequality is genuinely unstable, namely that the
                    supremum of the (perimeter normalized) first non-zero eigenvalue of the Steklov
                    problem can be achieved in the geometric neighbourhood of any smooth simply connected
                    domain of the plane. Time remaining, I will introduce a new method to prove
                    quantitative forms of spectral inequalities of Robin type which relies on the analysis
                    of a new class of geometric/energy functionals in the context of free discontinuity/free
                    boundary problems. This talk is a based on joint works with M. Nahon and A. Giacomini.

                    Since maximizing metrics for the Laplace eigenvalues, normalized by the area,
                    and the Steklov eigenvalues, normalized by the length of the boundary, arise as induced
                    metrics from minimal surfaces, we can try to solve these optimization problems to find
                    minimal surface. In the case of the Laplace operator on closed surfaces these are minimal
                    surfaces in round spheres. For Steklov eigenvalues on surfaces with boundary these are free
                    boundary minimal surfaces in Euclidean balls. Very recently, these maximization problems have
                    been fully settled in both cases for the first eigenvalue. In particular, this gives rise
                    to new examples of minimal surfaces of the aforementioned types. I will first give a very
                    brief sketch of the program to obtain these maximizing metrics. Then, I will try to give some
                    idea of our glueing constructions completing this program for the first eigenvalue. This is
                    based on joint work with Anna Siffert and joint work with Romain Petrides.

                    and give applications to the study of the $L^p$ norms of eigenfunctions for $p$ larger than the
                    critical exponent. In particular, we present quantitative improvements on the standard estimates
                    which rely only on dynamical assumptions. This is joint work with J. Galkowski.

                    Geometric optimization of Laplace eigenvalues on surfaces under the area constraint is closely
                    linked to the study of minimal surfaces in spheres and harmonic maps. I will discuss some recent
                    developments in the subject, including
                    a solution of the maximization problem for higher eigenvalues on the 2-sphere. The talk is based on
                    joint works with M. Karpukhin, N. Nadirashvili and A. Penskoi.

                    This talk will focus on the recent work, joint with Rafe
                    Mazzeo and Bin Xu, on the spectral properties of constant curvature
                    metrics with conical singularities on surfaces. We will focus on a
                    special class called spherical conical metrics with reducible
                    monodromy. We obtain a spectral characterization of the monodromy
                    property, which establishes a new connection between the geometric
                    microlocal analysis which is about the study of singular operators,
                    and the classical complex analysis approach that uses the developing
                    maps. Those spectral properties help us to understand the moduli
                    spaces of spherical conical metrics, which have seen a lot of recent
                    development and yet there are still a lot of open problems.

                    Berry's random wave conjecture is a heuristic that the eigenfunctions of a classically ergodic
                    system ought to display Gaussian random behaviour, as though they were random waves, in the large
                    eigenvalue limit. We discuss two aspects of this problems for eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on a
                    particular number-theoretic negatively curved surface: Planck scale mass equidistribution, and an
                    asymptotic for the fourth moment.

                    Comparison results (of isoperimetric type) for solutions to elliptic equations with Dirichlet and
                    Neumann boundary conditions have been established since decades. So far not many results have been
                    obtained in the case of Robin boundary conditions.
                    In this talk we investigate some open questions related to a Faber Krahn inequality and Talenti-type
                    estimates.

                    An old and important question about Laplacian eigenfunctions is to understand the size of the set
                    where they vanish (their nodal set): the idea is that eigenfunctions corresponding to larger
                    frequencies should oscillate more and thus vanish on a larger set. The same principle should then
                    also be true for linear combinations of high-frequency eigenfunctions (in one dimension, this
                    follows from Sturm-Liouville theory). Recent progress on this question is based on the notion of
                    optimal transport and a very simple idea which we formalize: if it's easy to buy milk, then there
                    must be many supermarkets (and, conversely, if there are only few supermarkets some people have to

                    I'll describe recent work with Mikhail Karpukhin, in which we relate the problem of maximizing
                    Laplacian eigenvalues over unit-area metrics on a given Riemann surface to natural constructions of
                    harmonic maps to high-dimensional spheres, via min-max methods for the Dirichlet energy. I'll
                    explain how our methods give a new construction of conformal metrics maximizing the first and second
                    Laplacian eigenvalues, and yield new estimates for other shape optimization problems in spectral
                    geometry — for instance providing asymptotically sharp upper bounds for the first two Steklov
                    eigenvalues on surfaces with fixed genus and any number of boundary components.

                    We consider the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a three-dimensional Riemannian manifold perturbed by a
                    rough potential from the Kato class and study whether various forms of Weyl's law remain valid under
                    this perturbation. In particular, we show that the pointwise Weyl law with sharp remainder estimate
                    is valid under an assumption that is slightly stronger than Kato class and that, on the other hand,
                    this sharp remainder estimate can be violated for Kato class potentials. For the proof we extend the
                    method of Avakumović to the case of Schrödinger operators with singular potentials.

                    There have been many developments on Steklov eigenvalue bounds over the last few years. We will
                    discuss how some of these bounds can be extended and improved for the mixed Steklov problem, in
                    particular, for the Steklov-Neumann problem. These bounds include Hersch-Payne-Schiffer inequality
                    and Weinstock inequality. The Steklov-Neuman eigenvalues problem naturally appears when we study the
                    Steklov problem on Riemannian orbifolds, and we also consider our results in this setting.

                    The zeta-regularized determinant of the Laplacian connects analysis, geometry, number theory, and
                    physics. It is simultaneously beautiful and elusive, because in general it is impossible to compute
                    in closed form, due to its global nature. To glean information, many have considered the variation
                    of the determinant, because in contrast, this is a local quantity. Here, we shall investigate the
                    variation of the determinant in singular geometric contexts. We will discuss so-called variational
                    Polyakov formulas for surfaces and domains with singularities and boundaries. For the special cases
                    of finite circular sectors and finite cones, we will show two different methods for obtaining the
                    variation of the determinant. At first glance, the formulas obtained via microlocal analysis versus
                    mathematical physics look quite different. It is an utter joy that although they appear different,
                    we can prove that the expressions are indeed the same. This talk is based on joint work with Clara
                    Aldana and Klaus Kirsten.

                    In my talk I will report on recent results about the spectral theory of elliptic systems on closed
                    manifolds.
                    <br> In the first part of the talk, I will present an explicit (i.e. up to solving ODEs), global (in
                    space and in time) and invariant (under changes of local coordinates and gauge transformations that
                    may be present) construction of wave propagators for first order systems, with a particular focus on
                    the Dirac operator on a closed 3-manifold. The core of our approach is the theory of global Fourier
                    integral operators with complex-valued phase functions developed by Laptev, Safarov and Vassiliev in
                    the nineties.
                    <br> In the second part of the talk, we will consider an elliptic pseudodifferential operator \(A\)
                    of arbitrary positive order acting on \(m\)-columns of half-densities and discuss how one can
                    partition its eigenvalues in precisely \(m\) (infinite) families, one for each eigenvalue of the
                    principal symbol of \(A\). Our results, which rely on the construction of an orthonormal
                    pseudodifferential basis, allow us to refine two-terms asymptotic formulae for the eigenvalue
                    counting function of \(A\) available in the literature. Furthermore, such a decomposition of the
                    spectrum of \(A\) provides some additional insight into the above propagator construction.

                    A Riemannian orbifold is a generalisation of a manifold in which the local structure is that of a
                    quotient of a Euclidean space by the action of a finite group of isometries. Such a local structure
                    allows using the tools of spectral geometry, including the Laplace operator and its spectrum. In
                    this context, a natural question is whether spectral data detects the presence of orbifold
                    singularities. In 2008 Dryden, Gordon, Greenwald and Webb gave a partial affirmative answer using
                    orbifold heat invariants for the Laplace operator acting on functions, however, there were some
                    remaining cases.
                    <br> In this talk I will discuss the computation of heat invariants for the Hodge Laplacian acting
                    on 1-forms on Riemmanian orbifolds. As an application, I will show how a combination of the heat
                    invariants for functions along with those for 1-forms allows us to distinguish a singular
                    \(n\)-dimensional orbifold from an \(n\)-dimensional manifold for \(n=2,3\). This is a joint work
                    with K. Gittins, C. Gordon, M. Khalile, M. Sandoval and E. Stanhope.

                    Courant’s nodal theorem tells us that an eigenfunction of the Laplacian associated with eigenvalue
                    number \(k\) has at most \(k\) nodal domains. Å. Pleijel showed
                    in 1956 that for a given planar domain, with a Dirichlet boundary condition,
                    equality can be reached only for a finite number of eigenvalues.
                    Pleijel’s proof actually gives an asymptotic upper bound of the number of
                    nodal domains. It has been extended afterwards to other geometric settings,
                    boundary conditions and operators. The topic has received a lot of attention in
                    the past decade and substantial progress has been made. Several generalizations
                    and refined versions have been obtained, and a large number of special cases
                    analyzed. I will describe these recent developments and the many open questions
                    in this area. This will include joint work with K. Gittins.

                    The earliest examples of non-isometric Laplace-isospectral manifolds have the same local geometries.
                    In fact, the first example of 16-tori given by Milnor and other isospectral pairs arising from the
                    classical group theoretic method of Sunada have the same local geometries. However, examples from
                    Gordon, Schueth, Sutton, and An-Yu-Yu demonstrate that in dimension four and higher, the local
                    geometry is not a spectral invariant, even among locally homogeneous spaces. Thus it is natural to
                    ask whether the local geometry is a spectral invariant in dimension two and three.
                    <br> I will present our result in this direction, which provides strong evidence that the local
                    geometry of a three-dimensional locally homogeneous space is a spectral invariant. This talk is
                    based on a joint work with Ben Schmidt and Craig Sutton.

                    In this talk, we will review some recent (and not so recent) results
                    concerning the number of critical points of Laplace eigenfunctions on
                    manifolds. We will outline the construction of smooth metrics on the
                    torus and on the sphere such that certain eigenfunctions have either
                    very few or infinitely many critical points. We will also discuss some
                    stability results. This talk includes joint work with Pierre Bérard and
                    Bernard Helffer.

                Weyl remainders: an application of geodesic beams

                    In this talk we discuss quantitative improvements for Weyl remainders under dynamical assumptions on
                    the geodesic flow. We consider a variety of Weyl type remainders including asymptotics for the
                    eigenvalue counting function as well as for the on and off-diagonal spectral projector. These
                    improvements are obtained by combining the geodesic beam approach to understanding eigenfunction
                    concentration together with an appropriate decomposition of the spectral projector into quasimodes
                    for the Laplacian. One consequence of these estimates is a quantitatively improved Weyl remainder
                    for the eigenvalue counting function that holds for all product manifolds. This is joint work with
                    J. Galkowski.

                    The Laplacian is a canonical second order elliptic operator defined on any Riemannian manifold. The
                    study of upper bounds for its eigenvalues is a classical problem of spectral geometry going back to
                    J. Hersch, P. Li and S.-T. Yau. It turns out that the optimal isoperimetric inequalities for
                    Laplacian eigenvalues are closely related to minimal surfaces in spheres. At the same time, the
                    index of a minimal surface is defined as a number of negative eigenvalues of a different second
                    order elliptic operator. It measures the instability of the surface as a critical point of the area
                    functional.

                    In the present talk we will discuss the interplay between index and Laplacian eigenvalues, and
                    present some recent applications, including a new bound on the index of minimal spheres as well as
                    the optimal isoperimetric inequality for Laplacian eigenvalues on the projective plane.

                    Humans tend to be better at physics than at mathematics. When an apple falls from a tree, there are
                    more people who can catch it—they physically know how the apple moves—than people who can compute
                    its trajectory from a differential equation. Applying physical ideas to discover and prove
                    mathematical results is therefore natural, even if it has seldom been tried in the history of
                    science. (The exceptions include Archimedes, some old Russian sources, a recent book of Levi's, as
                    well as my articles and lectures.) A variety of examples will be presented.
