                    I will talk about comparison principles in (spectral) geometry, describe related phenomena and
                    applications to eigenvalue inequalities. In particular, I will tell about new inequalities for
                    Laplace eigenvalues in terms of Berger’s embolic volume. Time permitting, I will also discuss
                    comparison principles and eigenvalue bounds for minimal surfaces.

                    Shape optimisation is a recurrent theme in spectral geometry: given an operator
                    and some boundary conditions, what is the optimal domain for the associated
                    eigenvalue problem. Traditionally, different boundary conditions and different
                    operators are treated independently. I will present a unifying framework based
                    on measure theory for treating many different optimisation problem at once, and
                    to relate them to one another.

                    As an application, we will see that from the shape optimisation perspective, the
                    Steklov, Laplace, and Neumann problems can be regrouped as part of a larger
                    class, and how to use those methods to look for optimisers and their properties.

                    In joint work with San Vũ Ngọc we study classical and quantum systems
                    with one degree of freedom, for which the energy profile (defined on a
                    surface) reaches its minimum on a closed curve. A typical example is a
                    massive particle moving on a circle and subject to a magnetic field. The
                    quantum version of such problems is, in particular, useful as an
                    effective model for studying magnetic fields in several degrees of
                    freedom, and we exhibit an oscillation phenomenon for small eigenvalues,
                    similar to the "Little-Parks" in supraconductors. <br>
                    In this talk, I will show how to "solve" the classical problem, that is,
                    find good coordinates which simplify it: Then I will discuss the quantum
                    version of this simplification, and notably the origin of these
                    oscillations. <br>
                    This talk is, hopefully, accessible without any particular knowledge of
                    semiclassical analysis.

                    In this talk we present a new type of boundary conditions for the
                    Bilaplacian, that we will call Robin boundary conditions. This new problem can
                    be thought of as a model for elastically supported plates, and moreover turns
                    out to be closely related to the study of spaces of traces of Sobolev functions.
                    We will start by recalling some known properties of the Robin Laplacian as a
                    motivation for its fourth-order counterpart, then we will introduce the Robin
                    Bilaplacian operator. We will then analyze the dependence of the operator,
                    its eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions on the Robin parameters, with a particular
                    focus on the asymptotics as the parameters tend to infinity. We will conclude by
                    considering the dependence on smooth perturbations of the domain, computing
                    the shape derivatives of the eigenvalues and giving a characterization for critical
                    domains under volume and perimeter constraints.

                    With Greg Berkolaiko, Yaiza Canzani and Graham Cox, we consider a family of periodic tight-binding
                    models (which are combinatorial graphs with Laplacian operators that have edge weights parametrized
                    over tori). It will be important that our graphs have the minimal number of links between copies of
                    the fundamental domain. For this family of graphs, we establish a local condition of second
                    derivative type under which the critical points of the dispersion relation can be recognized as
                    global maxima or minima. We will try to give an introduction to periodic graphs, as well as their
                    applications. In addition, we will demonstrate our results with a number of example graphs.

                    The second eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian is maximal for a ball under volume normalization, by
                    Weinberger (1956). For simply connected planar domains, Szegö did it two years earlier using
                    conformal mapping. The third eigenvalue is maximal for a disjoint union of two balls having the same
                    size, by Bucur and Henrot (2019). For simply connected planar domains, Girouard, Nadirashvili and
                    Polterovich did it ten years earlier. This talk explores the general approach of these authors in
                    terms of trial functions constructed by even reflection (“folding over a hyperplane”), and provides
                    a new proof of a key step in Bucur and Henrot’s argument. A starring role is played by a homotopy
                    result of Petrides that has the flavor of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. This new approach yields a
                    two-ball upper bound on the third eigenvalue for domains in hyperbolic space. (Joint work with Pedro
                    Freitas.)

                    The hot spots conjecture says that a second Neumann
                    eigenfunction of a domain in a Euclidean space can not attain its global
                    extrema in the interior of the domain. I shall try to provide a brief
                    survey of the known results on this topic. In particular, I will try to
                    explain a recent result of myself with Chris Judge that provides an
                    affirmative answer to the conjecture for triangular domains in the plane.

                    Among optimization problems for eigenvalues od Euclidean domains, the
                    most common
                    geometric constraints which have been considered are the volume or
                    perimeter constraints.
                    Here in this talk we consider a constraint on the diameter.
                    First, we consider the minimization of the Dirichlet eigenvalues. It is easy
                    to see that the minimizer exists and is a convex domain of constant width.
                    Then we prove that the disk is a local minimizer only for a finite (and
                    explicit)
                    list of indices. At last, we study the limit of the optimal domain for
                    \(\lambda_k\) when \(k\to \infty\).
                    Then, we consider the problem of maximizing the \(k\)-th Steklov
                    eigenvalue among
                    convex domains. Existence of a maximizer is not difficult to prove.
                    Even if the disk is always a critical point, we prove that it is never
                    a maximizer. We also prove that, for the optimal domain, the eigenvalue
                    is always multiple.
                    In both cases, we present some numerical results.
                    This is a joint work with Beni Bogosel, Ilaria Lucardesi, Abdelkader Al
                    Sayed and Florent Nacry.

                    We will discuss zero sets of Steklov eigenfunctions: we show that there are many zeros near the
                    boundary and improve on previous lower and upper bounds for the Hausdorff measure of the zero set;
                    several questions remain unanswered. Comparisons with the (slightly) better understood case of
                    eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator will also be provided.

                    The Steklov problem consists of studying the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the Dirichlet to
                    Neumann map on a compact manifold, \(M\), with boundary. While the high energy behavior of the
                    eigenfunctions on the boundary of \(M\) resembles that of high energy Laplace eigenfunctions, their
                    behavior in the interior of \(M\) is very different. In this talk, we discuss the decay and
                    oscillatory properties of these eigenfunctions in the interior of \(M\).

                    The relationship between the Steklov eigenvalues of a Riemannian manifold and the geometry of its
                    boundary has received a great deal of attention in recent years.
                    One way to gain insight into this relationship is to obtain bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues in
                    terms of some of the geometric quantities of the manifold and its boundary.
                    We first recall some known geometric upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues of a Riemannian
                    manifold.
                    We then consider the Steklov eigenvalues of a submanifold of Euclidean space and present
                    some geometric upper bounds involving the intersection index of the manifold and that of its
                    boundary.
                    <br>
                    This is based on joint work with Bruno Colbois (Université de Neuchâtel).

                    The spectra of large locally uniform geometries
                    have been studied widely and from different points of view,
                    including in applications. They include Ramanujan Graphs and Buildings,
                    euclidean and hyperbolic spaces and more general locally symmetric spaces. We review some of these
                    briefly highlighting rigidity features. We then focus on the simplest case of finite cubic graphs
                    which prove to be surprisingly rich. As one imposes restrictions on these graphs, planarity,
                    fullerenes, ... their spectra become rigid.

                    The results of this talk have been obtained in collaboration with
                    Chiu-Yen Kao and Braxton Osting. <br>
                    The first part of the talk is dedicated to Nash's isometric embedding
                    theorem for surfaces. We recall the impressive results obtained by
                    HEVEA's project for the flat torus (V. Borrelli, F. Lazarus, B. Thibert
                    et al.) and illustrate how spectral formulation may lead to a new
                    intrinsic numerical approach which are not related to Gromov's construction.<br>
                    Following the theoretical results of Fraser and Schoen, we describe in a
                    second part a numerical process to approximate minimal surfaces in the
                    ball. That is surfaces
                    <ul>
                        <li>contained in the ball</li>
                        <li>that have zero mean curvature</li>
                        <li>and
                            meet the boundary of the ball orthogonally.</li>
                    </ul>
                    For genus \(\gamma=0\) and \(b= 2, \cdots , 9, 12, 15, 20\) boundary components, we
                    numerically solve the extremal Steklov problem for the first eigenvalue.
                    The corresponding eigenfunctions generate a free boundary minimal
                    surface, which have not been observed previously.

                    We consider the Dirichlet Laplace operator in a bounded domain with Lipschitz-
                    regular boundary and study the asymptotic behaviour of its eigenvalues. In particular,
                    we prove a two-term asymptotic expansion for the sum of eigenvalues and show that the
                    obtained remainder is optimal. <br>

                    In this talk I will present some work with Rozenblum from 2009. While it has been known for more
                    than half a century that the Laplace operator on a smooth, bounded domain may have essential
                    spectrum if the boundary conditions are suitably chosen, typical choices involved non-local
                    operators. In this talk I will show, with very elementary arguments, that even local boundary
                    conditions, singular even just at a single point - can have a huge impact on the spectrum and
                    eigenfunctions. The example we consider, first proposed by Berry and Dennis. still has empty
                    essential spectrum and compact resolvent. However Weyl’s law fails completely because the spectrum
                    becomes unbounded below. The positive eigenvalues still obey Weyl asymptotics, to leading order;
                    however the (absolute values of the) negative eigenvalues do not obey a power law distribution. <br>
                    I will also make some remarks and ask some questions about nodal domains, which were not addressed
                    in our paper.

                    We show norm resolvent convergence for the Laplacian on a
                    family of domains with many small holes taken out. The critical
                    parameter here is the capacity of the small holes. If the density of
                    holes is below the critical parameter, then the limit operator is the
                    free Laplacian, in the critical case, an extra potential term appears.
                    The proof relies on an abstract convergence scheme for operators acting
                    in varying Hilbert spaces.

                    We discuss spectral properties of Laplace operator in spiral-shaped regions
                    with Dirichlet boundary, in particular, their discrete spectrum. As a case
                    study we analyze in detail the region generated by the Archimedean spiral,
                    where in contrast to ‘less curved’ tubular regions the discrete part is empty
                    due to a subtle diﬀerence between the radial and perpendicular widths,
                    and the spectrum is absolutely continuous away from the thresholds. For
                    more general spiral regions the spectral nature depends substantially on
                    whether their coil width is ‘expanding’ or ‘shrinking’ with respect to the
                    angle; the most interesting situation occurs in the case we call asymptotically
                    Archimedean, where the existence of isolated eigenvalues depends on the sign
                    of the leading term in the asymptotics.

                    Besides their self-evident geometric significance, which can be traced back at least to Courant,
                    free boundary minimal surfaces also naturally arise in partitioning problems for convex bodies, in
                    capillarity problems for fluids and, as has significantly emerged in recent years thanks to work of
                    Fraser and Schoen, in connection to extremal metrics for Steklov eigenvalues for manifolds with
                    boundary (i. e. for eigenvalues of the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann map).
                    <br>
                    The theory has been developed in various interesting directions, yet many fundamental questions
                    remain open. One of the most basic ones can be phrased as follows: does the Euclidean unit ball
                    contain free boundary minimal surfaces of any given topological type? In spite of significant
                    advances, the answer to such a question has proven to be very elusive. I will present some joint
                    work with Giada Franz and Mario Schulz where we answer (in the affirmative) the well-known question
                    whether there exist in \(B^3\) (embedded) free boundary minimal surfaces of genus one and one
                    boundary
                    component. In fact, we prove a more general result: for any g there exists in \(B^3\) an embedded
                    free
                    boundary minimal surface of genus \(g\) and connected boundary. The proof builds on global
                    variational
                    methods, in particular on a suitable equivariant counterpart of the Almgren-Pitts min-max theory,
                    and on a striking application of Simon's lifting lemma.

                    The question asked in the title is addressed from two points of view: First, it will be shown that
                    providing enough (term to be explained) spectral data, suffices to reconstruct a wide class of
                    matrices. Second, a newly developed trace formula for Hermitian matrices will be shown to be
                    intimately connected to this construction.

                    Our study is motivated by earlier results about nodal count of
                    Laplacian eigenfunctions on manifolds and graphs that share the same
                    flavor: the nodal count's "deviation" is equal to the Morse index of a
                    certain "energy functional" . In the hindsight, in all these results, the nodal count can
                    be understood as the spectral shift resulting from perturbing the
                    operator in an appropriate way. This brings us to the following
                    general result (joint with G. Berkolaiko): the spectral shift can be recovered as the stability
                    (Morse)
                    index of the eigenvalue with respect to small "lateral" variations of
                    the perturbation.

                    We consider self-adjoint operators of the form \(\mathbf{T}_{P,\mathfrak{A}}=\mathfrak{A}^* P
                    \mathfrak{A}\) in a domain \(\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^\mathbf{N}\), where \(\mathfrak{A}\) is an
                    order
                    \(-l=-\mathbf{N}/2\) pseudodifferential operator in \(\Omega\) and \(P\) is a signed Borel measure
                    with
                    compact support in \(\Omega\). Measure \(P\) may contain singular component. For a wide class of
                    measures we establish eigenvalue estimates for operator \(\mathbf{T}_{P,\mathfrak{A}}\). In case of
                    measure \(P\) being absolutely continuous with respect to the Hausdorff measure on a Lipschitz
                    surface
                    of an arbitrary dimension, we find the eigenvalue asymptotics. The order of eigenvalue estimates and
                    asymptotics does not depend on dimensional characteristics of the measure, in particular, on the
                    dimension of the surface supporting the measure. The typical example is the spectral problem
                    \(\lambda (1-\Delta)^{N/2}u =P u\).

                    Courant's nodal domain theorem, which says the \(n\)th Laplacian
                    eigenfunction has at most \(n\) nodal domains, is almost always a strict
                    inequality. The extent to which it fails to be sharp is measured by the
                    nodal deficiency. Despite much study, this quantity is still not very
                    well understood except in highly symmetric cases. However, in the last
                    decade two general formulas for the nodal deficiency were established.
                    <br>
                    The first was given in 2012 by Berkolaiko, Kuchment and Smilansky, using
                    an energy functional defined on the space of equipartitions of the
                    domain. More recently, with Jones and Marzuola, I obtained a formula for
                    the nodal deficiency in terms of a two-sided Dirichlet-to-Neumann map
                    defined on the nodal set.
                    <br>
                    After reviewing both of these results, I will describe new work (with
                    Gregory Berkolaiko, Yaiza Canzani and Jeremy Marzuola) that demonstrates
                    a direct connection between these seemingly different approaches to
                    nodal deficiency. Among other things, it gives a method for using the
                    Dirichlet-to-Neumann map to calculate eigenfunctions for the Hessian of
                    the equipartition energy, and provides insight into the theory of
                    spectral minimal partitions.

                    We study a semilinear eigenvalue problem involving the Laplace operator with Robin boundary
                    conditions among sets of fixed measure in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). In particular, consider a solid \(D\)
                    with a
                    constant volumetric heat source and a thin layer of insulator on its surface, and let \(T(D)\) be
                    the
                    mean temperature of \(D\) at equilibrium. We will present a proof of \(T(D)\leq
                    T(D^*)-C.d(D,D^*)^2\),
                    where \(d\) is the \(L^1\) distance between sets up to translation and \(D^*\) is the ball with same
                    measure as \(D\).
                    This will be obtained through a shape optimisation problem involving both free discontinuity and
                    free boundary phenomena.

                    The second nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian on \(S^{m}\) becomes maximal as the surface
                    degenerates
                    to two disjoint spheres, by a result of Nadirashvili for which Petrides later gave another proof.
                    This talk builds on recent developments on the hyperbolic center of mass to simplify the proof,
                    yielding also the analogous result in higher dimensions.

                    associated
                    warping function up to a natural invariance. Then, we study the

                    product with respect to the Steklov spectrum.

                    In this talk I will discuss bounds for the first eigenvalue of the Paneitz operator \(P\) and its
                    associated third-order boundary operator \(B^3\) on four-manifolds. We restrict to orientable,
                    simply
                    connected, locally confomally flat manifolds that have at most two umbilic boundary components. The
                    proof is based on showing that under the hypotheses of the main theorems, the considered manifolds
                    are confomally equivalent to canonical models. The fact that \(P\) and \(B^3\) are conformal in four
                    dimensions is key in the proof.

                    Laplacian. In the two dimensional situation, we determine an effective operator describing the
                    asymptotic distribution of the negative eigenvalues, and we prove that the corresponding
                    eigenfunctions decay away from the boundary, for all dimensions.

                    An important problem in numerical analysis is the solution of the Helmholtz equation in exterior
                    domains, in variable media; this models
                    the scattering of time-harmonic waves. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a flexible and powerful
                    tool for obtaining numerical solutions,
                    but difficulties are known to arise in obtaining convergence estimates for FEM that are uniform as
                    the frequency of waves tends to infinity. I will describe some recent joint work with David
                    Lafontaine and Euan Spence that yields new convergence results for the FEM which are uniform in the
                    frequency parameter. The essential new tools come from semiclassical microlocal analysis and the use
                    of the functional calculus. Another ingredient is a slightly surprising new resolvent estimate.

                    The nodal set of a Laplacian eigenfunction forms a partition of the underlying manifold or graph.
                    Another natural partition is based on the gradient vector field of the eigenfunction (on a manifold)
                    or on the extremal points of the eigenfunction (on a graph).
                    The submanifolds (or subgraphs) of this partition are called Neumann domains (you may guess the
                    reason for this name, and it would also be mentioned in the talk ;)
                    We present results for Neumann domains on manifolds and on graphs - their count, geometric
                    properties and spectral positions.
                    The Neumann domain results are compared to those of the nodal domain study.

                    A free boundary minimal surface (FBMS) in the unit ball is a minimal surface
                    \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{B}\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) which satisfies one of the two following equivalent
                    conditions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>\(\Omega\) meets the boundary \(\partial\mathbb{B}\) orthogonally,</li>
                        <li>The coordinate functions \(x_i:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}\) are Steklov eigenfunctions with
                            eigenvalue
                            \(\sigma=1\).</li>
                    </ul>
                    The study of FBMS is witnessing a renaissance thanks to the fundamental work of Fraser and Schoen,
                    who discovered that isoperimetric optimizers for the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue
                    \(\sigma_1(\Omega)\) of surfaces lead to the existence of FBMS with prescribed topology. For
                    surfaces
                    of genus 0, they proved existence of maximizers for the perimeter-normalized \(\sigma_1(\Omega)\)
                    and
                    thereby obtained several new FBMS.
                    In this talk I will show how this link can be used to obtain a sequence of FBMS
                    \(\Omega^n\subset\mathbb{B}\) such that \(\text{area}(\Omega^n)\rightarrow 4\pi\) as \(n\to\infty\).
                    This is
                    based on a construction of domains in the sphere \(\mathbb{S}^2\) with perimeter-normalized
                    \(\sigma_1(\Omega)\) converging to \(8\pi\). These domains are obtained by removing small disks from
                    the
                    sphere, in the spirit of homogenization theory. I will also dicuss a conjecture by Fraser and Li,
                    stating that \(\sigma_1(\Omega)=1\) for each FBMS \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{B}\). More precisely, I
                    will
                    show that the conjecture is true for some FBMS which are invariant under the action of the symmetry
                    group of some platonic solids.

                    In this talk, we review the asymptotic expansions of the heat traces for various operators including
                    the Laplace operator, the poly-Laplace operator, the Maxwell operator, the Stokes operator, etc.
                    Then for the elastic Navier-Lame operator (a non-Laplace type operator) on a compact connected
                    Riemannian \(n\)-manifold \(M\) with smooth boundary, we explicitly obtain the first two
                    coefficients of the
                    asymptotic expansion of the heat trace for Navier-Lame operator with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
                    conditions. These two coefficients provide precise information for the volume of the elastic body
                    \(M\) and the surface area of the boundary in terms of the spectrum of the Navier-Lame operator.
                    This gives an answer to an interesting and open problem mentioned by Avramidi.

                    The connection between the formation of internal waves in fluids, spectral
                    theory and the dynamics of homeomorphisms of the circle was investigated by
                    oceanographers in the 90s and resulted in novel experimental
                    observations (Maas et al, 1997). The specific homeomorphism is given
                    by a chess billiard and has been considered by many authors (John
                    1941, Arnold 1957, Ralston 1973, ... , Lenci et al 2021). The relation
                    between the nonlinear dynamics of this homeomorphism and linearized
                    internal waves provides a striking example of classical/quantum
                    correspondence (in a classical and surprising setting of fluids!).
                    Using a model of tori and of zeroth order pseudodifferential
                    operators, it has been a subject of recent research, first by Colin de
                    Verdière-Saint Raymond 2020 and then by Dyatlov, Galkowski, Wang and
                    the speaker. In this talk I will review those results and present
                    new work, with Dyatlov and Wang, on the more physically relevant boundary value
                    problem.

                    Stability questions for sharp inequalities are important problems in analysis. Recently, these
                    questions have been investigated for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on Euclidean domains.
                    Optimal stability estimates for Faber-Krahn and Szego-Weinberger inequalities were obtained by
                    Brasco-De Philippis-Velichkov and Nadirashvili, Brasco-Pratelli respectively. In the present talk we
                    first consider the stability of another fundamental inequality in spectral geometry: Hersch
                    inequality for the first eigenvalue on the 2-dimensional sphere. We then present generalizations to
                    other surfaces and the related problems from harmonic maps and minimal surfaces. Finally, if time
                    permits, potential applications to Steklov eigenvalue problem will be discussed. Based on the joint
                    work with M. Nahon, I. Polterovich and D. Stern.

                    In this talk I will explain how to construct counterexamples for two problems in spectral geometry.
                    The main novelty is that parts of the proofs will be done via a rigorous computer-assisted proof. In
                    the first part of the talk, I will explain how to prove that a triangle is not determined by its
                    first, second and fourth (Dirichlet) eigenvalues, solving a conjecture by Antunes and Freitas. In
                    the second part I will construct a planar domain with 6 holes for which the nodal line is closed and
                    does not touch the boundary. In particular, this domain does not satisfy Payne's nodal line
                    conjecture. This gives a partial answer on a question posed by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof
                    and Nadirashvili asking what should be the minimal number of holes of such domains.
                    <br>
                    The results are joint work with Joel Dahne, Kimberly Hou and Gerard Orriols.

                    Since the seminal works of Hermann Weyl at the beginning of the 20th century, several authors have
                    investigated the spectral asymptotics of partial differential operators. Following this tradition,
                    in this talk I will first present a recent result on a new proof of Weyl's law for the buckling
                    eigenvalues requiring minimal assumptions on the domain. The proof relies on asymptotically sharp
                    lower and upper bounds that we develop for Riesz means. Moreover, we compute the second term in
                    Weyl's law in the case of balls and bounded intervals. This, together with some formal
                    considerations, leads us to state a conjecture for the second term in general domains.
                    <br>
                    The talk is based on a joint work with Davide Buoso (UPO), Luigi Provenzano (Sapienza Università di
                    Roma), and Joachim Stubbe (EPFL).

                    We shall proof of a Lieb-Thirring type inequality for Jacobi matrices originally conjectured by
                    Hundertmark and Simon. In particular, we show that the estimate on the sum of eigenvalues does not
                    depend on the off-diagonal terms as long as they are smaller than their asymptotic value. An
                    interesting feature of the proof is that it employs a technique originally used by
                    Hundertmark-Laptev-Weidl concerning sums of singular values for compact operators.

                    My talk is about Fourier expansions of restrictions of eigenfunctions on
                    a Riemannian manifold \(M\) to a submanifold \(H\), in terms of eigenfunctions of \(H\). This
                    problem originated in automorphic forms in work of Hecke, Maass, Selberg, Roelcke, Rankin and others
                    and further developed by Bruggemann, Kuznecov, Hejhal, Good, Wolpert and Marshall on hyperbolic
                    surfaces. More recently, there are many articles studying \(L^2\) norms of restrictions or their
                    integrals over \(H\) against a fixed function. Recently, Wyman, Xi and I have been studying general
                    Fourier coefficients of restrictions with constraints on the ratio of the M-eigenvalue and the
                    \(H\)-eigenvalue. Extremes are restrictions of Gaussian beams along a closed geodesic to the
                    geodesic
                    (which have just one non-zero Fourier coefficient of maximal size) or restrictions of ergodic
                    eigenfunctions of negatively curved surfaces to a close geodesic, where one expects all Fourier
                    coefficients in the allowed range to be of the same small size. My talk will review some of the
                    classical results for motivation and then
                    focus on recent (in progress) results at the edge of the Fourier spectrum when \(H\) is totally
                    geodesic.

                    The spectral gap of the Neumann and Dirichlet Laplacians are each known to have a sharp positive
                    lower bound among convex domains of a given diameter. Between these cases, for each positive value
                    of the Robin parameter an analogous sharp lower bound on the spectral gap is conjectured. In this
                    talk we show the extension of this conjecture to negative Robin parameters fails by proving that the
                    spectral gap of double cone domains are exponentially small, for each fixed parameter value.

                    We establish semiclassical asymptotics or estimates for the Schwartz kernel \(e_h(x,y;\tau)\) of
                    spectral projector for a second order elliptic operator on a manifold with a boundary. While such
                    asymptotics for its restriction to the diagonal \(e_h(x,x,\tau)\) and, especially, for its trace
                    \(N_h(\tau)= \int e_h(x,x,\tau)\,dx\) are well-known, the out-of-diagonal asymptotics are much less
                    explored.
