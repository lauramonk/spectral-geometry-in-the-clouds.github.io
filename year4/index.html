                Maximal multiplicity of Laplacian eigenvalues in negatively curved surfaces

                    The problem of finding the maximal possible multiplicity of the first Laplacian eigenvalues has been
                    studied at least since the 1970’s. Colin de Verdière (1986) showed that on any closed manifold of
                    dimension at least 3 the multiplicity of the first non-trivial Laplacian eigenvalue can be made
                    arbitrarily large by an appropriate choice of metric. On surfaces, finding upper bounds on the
                    multiplicity is a difficult problem; Cheng (1975) and then Besson (1980) proved bounds which are
                    linear in the genus \(g\) of the surface.
                    <br>
                    I will present a recent work in collaboration with Simon Machado (ETH) in which we proved, for
                    negatively curved surfaces, the first upper bound which is sublinear in the genus \(g\). Our method
                    is
                    robust enough to also yield an upper bound
                    on the “approximate multiplicity” of eigenvalues, i.e., the number of eigenvalues in windows of size
                    \(1/\log^\kappa(g)\), \(\kappa>0\), and this upper bound is shown to be nearly sharp.
                    <br>
                    Our proof combines a trace argument for the heat kernel and the idea of leveraging an \(r\)-net in
                    the
                    surface to control this trace. The latter idea has been introduced in the context of graphs of
                    bounded degree in a paper of Jiang-Tidor-Yao-Zhang-Zhao (2021). Our work provides new insights on a
                    conjecture by Colin de Verdière and a new way to transfer spectral results from graphs to surfaces.

                    It is a well-known fact in control theory, that null-controllability in time \(T\) of a control
                    system
                    given by an inhomogeneous Cauchy problem is equivalent to final-state-observability of the
                    associated dual system. A key ingredient to show the latter property is the availability of a
                    spectral inequality for elements in the range of the spectral projection of an appropriate operator
                    up to a certain energy value. In this talk we explain what a spectral inequality is and we present a
                    general framework based on complex analytical technique to obtain them for a certain class of
                    domains and operators. Moreover, we will expand our results to the realm of graphs. The main ideas
                    are a generalization of techniques first exploited by Kovrijkine to study functions with compactly
                    supported Fourier Transform. This talk is based on a joint work with Ivan Veselic (TU Dortmund),
                    Albrecht Seelmann (TU Dortmund) and Delio Mugnolo (FernUni Hagen).

                    The Poincaré equation describes the motion of an incompressible
                    fluid in a domain submitted to a rotation.
                    The associated wave operator is called the "Poincaré operator".
                    If the domain is an ellipsoid, it was observed by several physicists that
                    the spectrum is pure point with polynomial eigenfields.
                    I will give a conceptual proof of this fact and an asymptotic result on the
                    eigenvalues.

                    Denoting the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of a bounded Lipschitz domain \(\Omega \subset
                    \mathbb{R}^{d}\) by \(0<\lambda_{1}(\Omega) \leq \lambda_{2}(\Omega) \leq \lambda_{3}(\Omega) \leq
                        \cdots \) and \(0=\mu_{1}(\Omega) \leq \mu_{2}(\Omega) \leq \mu_{3}(\Omega) \leq \cdots \)
                        respectively, the well-known Weyl asymptotic formula asserts that \begin{equation}
                        \lambda_{k}(\Omega) \sim \mu_{k}(\Omega) \sim W_{d}k^{2/d}|\Omega|^{-2/d}, \enspace \text{as}
                        \enspace k\to +\infty, \end{equation} where \(W_{d}>0\) is the Weyl constant depending only on
                        the
                        dimension \(d\) and \(|\Omega|\) is the volume of \(\Omega\).
                        <br>
                        In spectral shape optimisation problems, it is often desirable to have stability of the Weyl
                        asymptotic formula for sequences of domains under some prescribed geometric conditions. For
                        example, if one has a sequence of bounded Lipschitz domains \(\Omega_{k} \subset
                        \mathbb{R}^{d}\)
                        of unit volume, under which further geometric conditions on the \(\Omega_{k}\) is it true that
                        \begin{equation}
                        \lambda_{k}(\Omega_{k}) \sim \mu_{k}(\Omega_{k}) \sim W_{d}k^{2/d}, \enspace \text{as} \enspace
                        k\to +\infty?
                        \end{equation} One can ask similar questions more generally regarding the asymptotic behaviour
                        of suprema/infima of Dirichlet/Neumann eigenvalues over collections of bounded Lipschitz
                        domains.
                        <br>
                        We will discuss proofs of results in this spirit for bounded convex domains and consider some
                        applications of these ideas in obtaining asymptotic results for spectral shape optimisation
                        problems. In particular, we will consider minimising Dirichlet, Neumann and mixed
                        Dirichlet-Neumann eigenvalues over collections of convex domains of a prescribed perimeter or
                        diameter.

                    We generalize a classical inequality between the eigenvalues
                    of the Laplacians with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on
                    bounded, planar domains: in 1955, Payne proved that below the \(k\)-th
                    eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian there exist at least \(k+2\)
                    eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian, provided the domain is convex. It
                    has, however, been conjectured that this should hold for any domain.
                    Here we show that the statement indeed remains true for all simply
                    connected planar Lipschitz domains. The proof relies on a novel
                    variational principle.

                    The optimization of Laplace eigenvalues with respect to metrics in a given conformal class naturally
                    leads to a correspondence between critical metrics and harmonic maps to spheres, the maps being
                    given component wise by the corresponding eigenfunctions. In my talk, I will look at the
                    optimization of Dirac eigenvalues and discuss the similarities and differences of this problem with
                    the Laplace one. Indeed, in this case we still obtain a correspondence of critical metric with
                    harmonic maps, but this time the maps are to complex projective spaces and need to satisfy
                    additional conditions. I will also give some applications to the minimization of Dirac eigenvalues
                    on the sphere and the torus. This talk is based on joint work with Mikhail Karpukhin and Iosif
                    Polterovich.

                    In a first part I will discuss results concerning the existence of optimal metrics for the conformal
                    curl eigenvalue and their relation to conformal eigenvalues of the Laplace-operator. In a second
                    part I will discuss the question of existence of optimal domains for the first curl eigenvalue under
                    a volume constraint. I will present existence results within certain subclasses of domains (e.g.
                    convex domains) and also discuss restrictions on possible optimal shapes in the general setting in
                    which the existence of optimal domains is still an open problem.

                    In a recent work with Vanderson Lima (UFRGS, Brazil), we introduced a family of functionals on the
                    space of Riemannian metrics of a compact surface with boundary, defined via eigenvalues of a
                    Steklov-type problem. In this talk we will prove that each such functional is uniformly bounded from
                    above, and we will characterize maximizing metrics as induced by free boundary minimal immersions in
                    some geodesic ball of a round sphere. Also, we will determine that the maximizer in the case of a
                    disk is a spherical cap of dimension two, and we will prove rotational symmetry of free boundary
                    minimal annuli in geodesic balls of round spheres which are immersed by first eigenfunctions.

                    In the last decades the study of geometric and analytical properties of metric measure spaces
                    satisfying synthetic Ricci curvature lower bounds has received a huge attention. However not much is
                    known about the classical topics of nodal sets and nodal domains of eigenfunctions of the Laplace
                    operator in this setting.
                    In this seminar we will show how the Peijel's nodal domain theorem can be proved in this possibly
                    singular setting where the main difficulty relies on the possibly non locally Riemannian structure
                    of the space.
                    The techniques used to face the problem in the case of Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacian on domains,
                    apply in the particular case of domains of the Euclidean space, allowing us to extend existing
                    results on the validity of the Pleijel's nodal domain theorem to a bigger class of sets.

                    A classical result of Uhlenbeck states that for a generic Riemannian metric, the Laplace spectrum is
                    simple, i.e., each eigenspace is real one-dimensional. On the other hand, manifolds with symmetries
                    do not typically have simple spectra. If a compact Lie group \(G\) acts on a manifold as isometries,
                    then each eigenspace is a representation of \(G\), and hence, the spectrum cannot be simple in
                    general.
                    That each eigenspace is an irreducible representation for a generic \(G\)-invariant metric is a
                    conjecture originating from quantum mechanics and atomic physics. In this work, we prove this
                    conjecture for torus actions.
                    <br>
                    We also prove that for a generic torus-invariant metric, if \(u\) is a real-valued, non-invariant
                    eigenfunction that vanishes on an orbit of the torus action, then the nodal set of \(u\) is a smooth
                    hypersurface. This result provides a large class of Riemannian manifolds such that almost every
                    eigenfunction has precisely two nodal domains. This starkly contrasts with previous results on the
                    number of nodal domains for surfaces with ergodic geodesic flows. This is a joint project with
                    Donato Cianci, Chris Judge, and Craig Sutton.

                    Consider a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension \(d\). Let \(u\) be an eigenfunction of the
                    Laplace-Beltrami operator with eigenvalue \(\lambda\).
                    Every connected component \(\Omega\) of \(u\neq 0\) is called a nodal domain of \(u\). It follows
                    from the
                    Faber-Krahn inequality that \(\text{Vol}(\Omega)\geq C \lambda^{-d/2}\), where \(C=C(M, g)>0\).
                    A refined question due to Leonid Polterovich is whether one can inscribe in \(\Omega\) a ball of
                    radius \(C\lambda^{-1/2}\).
                    The answer is positive in dimension two (M., 2006). In higher dimensions we show that this is true
                    up to a logarithmic power factor:
                    One can inscribe in \(\Omega\) a ball of radius \(C\lambda^{-1/2}(\log\lambda)^{-a_d}\).
                    where \(a_d\) is a positive constant depending on dimension only.
                    I will explain several ideas which go into the proof.

                    As a discrete analogue of Kac's celebrated question on “hearing the shape of a drum”, and towards a
                    practical graph isomorphism test, it is of interest to understand which graphs are determined up to
                    isomorphism by their spectrum (of their adjacency matrix). In this talk I'll introduce the topic and
                    discuss some recent work with Ilya Koval.

                    In this talk, I show how the spectral properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator
                    can be used to describe various characteristics of diffusion-controlled reactions, i.e.,
                    of reflected Brownian motion in an Euclidean domain with appropriate stopping conditions.
                    For instance, one can derive a spectral expansion for the probability flux density that
                    determines the joint probability law for the stopping time and location of the stochastic
                    process. I discuss the advantages of this approach as compared to conventional spectral
                    expansions based on the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator. In particular, the
                    Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator allows one to disentangle the diffusive dynamics in an
                    Euclidean domain from surface reactions on its boundary. Various numerical results in
                    the case of planar Euclidean domains with smooth and nonsmooth boundaries will be given.
                    Several conjectures on spectral properties of this operator and related open problems
                    will be presented.

                    "Are all gaps there?", asked Mark Kac in 1981 during a talk at the AMS annual meeting,
                    and offered ten Martinis for the answer.
                    This led Barry Simon to coin the names the Ten Martini Problem (TMP) and
                    the Dry Ten Martini Problem for two related problems concerning the Almost-Mathieu operator.
                    The TMP is about showing that the spectrum of the Almost-Mathieu operator is a Cantor set.
                    The Dry TMP is about the values that the integrated density of states (IDS) attains at the spectral
                    gaps.
                    The gap labelling theorem predicts the possible set of values which the IDS may attain at the
                    spectral gaps.
                    The Dry TMP is whether or not all these values are attained, or equivalently, "are all gaps there?".
                    <br>
                    The TMP was fully solved by Artur Avila and Svetlana Jitomirskaya in 2005.
                    Artur Avila, Jiangong You and Qi Zhou posted this year a preprint with the solution of the Dry TMP
                    for the non-critical case (the coupling constant of the potential differs from one).
                    <br>
                    This talk is about the Dry TMP for Sturmian Schrödinger operators.
                    These are one-dimensional Schrödinger operators with aperiodic potentials which are Sturmian
                    sequences.
                    The potential is determined in terms of two parameters: the frequency and the potential strength
                    (a.k.a coupling constant).
                    As for the Almost-Mathieu operator the Dry TMP is whether all the possible spectral gaps are there
                    for all irrational frequencies and all values of the coupling constant.
                    For large values of the coupling constant, the Sturmian Dry TMP was solved by Laurent Raymond in
                    1995.
                    In 2016, David Damanik, Anton Gorodetski and William Yessen provided a solution if the frequency is
                    the golden mean and for all couplings.
                    <br>
                    In our current work, jointly with Siegfried Beckus and Raphael Loewy, we solve the Sturmian Dry TMP
                    for all irrational frequencies and all couplings.

                    We will first address upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues, normalized by perimeter, of convex
                    polygons. We then turn to the inverse problem for the Steklov spectrum, establishing that generic
                    convex n-gons are determined up to finite many possibilities among all n-gons by their Steklov
                    spectra and seeking bounds on the size of isospectral sets. A sample result: Every convex \(n\)-gon
                    all of whose interior angles are obtuse and whose sides lengths are incommensurable over
                    \(\{-1,0,1\}\) is
                    uniquely determined by its Steklov spectrum among all \(n\)-gons.
                    <br>
                    Our main tools in addressing the inverse spectral problem are the very powerful Steklov spectral
                    invariants found by Stanislav Krymski, Michael Levitin, Leonid Parnovski, Iosif Polterovich and
                    David Sher and the new eigenvalue bounds mentioned above.

                    Recently, in [1] Lima and Menezes have found a connection between free boundary minimal immersions
                    in geodesic balls in the spherical caps and maximal metrics for a functional on the set of
                    Riemannian metrics on a given surface with boundary. In this talk I will explain how to extend their
                    result to the case of free boundary minimal immersions in geodesic balls in the hyperbolic space and
                    critical metrics for the high order generalization of the Lima-Menezes functional. Also, I plan to
                    consider some applications to the area index of free boundary minimal surfaces in geodesic balls in
                    the hyperbolic space and the upper half-sphere. This talk is based on my recent paper [2].

                    The isoperimetric inequality and coarea inequality are basic tools in Geometric Analysis. But what
                    if instead of applying them to a fixed submanifold we try to apply them to a continuous family of
                    submanifolds?
                    These "parametric" versions of classical inequalities are open problems. It turns out that they are
                    closely related to the properties of the "volume spectrum" - volumes of minimal submanifolds that
                    arise from Morse theory on the space of flat cycles. I will discuss proofs of these inequalities in
                    low dimensions, their applications to Weyl law for the volume spectrum in higher codimension and
                    existence results for minimal surfaces and stationary geodesic nets that follow from the Weyl law.
                    The talk will be based on joint works with Marques and Neves, Larry Guth and Bruno Staffa.

                    We discuss the recent result on establishing the Neumann-to-Dirichlet eigenvalue asymptotics formula
                    for an elliptic operator with very weak regularity of coefficients in a domain with Lipschitz
                    boundary. The approach is based upon an approximation of this, rather singular, problem by the ones
                    with smooth boundary and smooth coefficients.

                    SMPs offer a way of dividing a given object (domain, manifold or graph) into a given number of
                    pieces in an "analytically optimal" way: typically, one attempts to minimise an energy functional
                    defined on all \(k\)-partitions built out of some norm of (say) the first Dirichlet Laplacian
                    eigenvalue on each piece. They have deep connections both to fine spectral properties of the
                    Laplacian defined on the whole object, and also to purely geometric functionals/partitions such as
                    so-called Cheeger cuts.
                    <br>
                    We will start by giving a brief overview of SMPs in the particular context of metric graphs. These
                    are a useful sandbox since the existence theory is far easier than on domains or manifolds, but SMPs
                    on metric graphs still enjoy the same (or even more) connections to spectral theory as their
                    higher-dimensional counterparts. We will attempt to illustrate this principle with two new results
                    for metric graphs that should also hold, mutatis mutandis, on domains (with more difficult proofs).
                    <br>
                    First, we will discuss the problem of partitioning an unbounded graph, possibly equipped with an
                    underlying potential. The existence or non-existence of a minimising \(k\)-partition, for given
                    \(k\),
                    is closely related to the infimum of the essential spectrum of the operator on the whole graph, and
                    in particular whether there exists a "test" \(k\)-partition of energy below this infimum. This
                    directly parallels min-max-type principles for discrete eigenvalues of the operator at energies
                    below its essential spectrum.
                    <br>
                    Second, we will introduce partitions of compact graphs based on Robin Laplacian-type first
                    eigenvalues, where a Robin parameter \(\alpha > 0\) is imposed at all boundary points between
                    partition pieces; \(\alpha = \infty\) corresponds, formally, to the Dirichlet case. But as \(\alpha
                    \to
                    0\), the minimal partition energies, suitably normalised, converge to the purely geometric
                    \(k\)-Cheeger constant of the graph; and, up to a subsequence, the minimising partitions also
                    converge
                    in a natural Hausdorff sense to a \(k\)-Cheeger cut of the graph.

                    This talk will be based on the results of several projects with multiple different co-authors: Pavel
                    Kurasov, Corentin Léna and Delio Mugnolo; Matthias Hofmann and Andrea Serio; and João Ribeiro.

                    Fiedler proposed the "algebraic connectivity" — i.e., the spectral gap of the graph Laplacian —
                    as a measure of connectivity of discrete graphs; an analogous idea was substantiated by a two-sided
                    bound on the spectral gap of the metric graph Laplacian obtained by Nicaise (1987) and
                    Kennedy-Kurasov-Malenová-Mugnolo (2016).
                    <br>
                    Further, possibly "more geometric" quantities can be shown to describe the connectivity of a
                    metric graph, too. I will focus on the mean distance, a rather natural quantity that can be defined
                    on each compact metric measure space.
                    After presenting geometric bounds on this quantity, I will show its interplay with the spectral gap
                    of the metric graph Laplacian and outline some similarities with the Kohler-Jobin inequality for
                    metric graphs.
                    This is joint work with Luis Baptista and James B. Kennedy.

                    A GCD matrix is a (finite or semi-infinite) matrix whose \((n,m)\)'th matrix entry involves the
                    greatest
                    common divisor of \(n\) and \(m\). I will discuss what is known about the spectral analysis of such
                    matrices. This question has a classical nature but it came to the attention of analysts in recent
                    years in connection with some questions of analytic number theory.

                    In the setting of negatively curved manifolds of dimension \(n\geq3\), we consider the Steklov
                    eigenvalue problem on compact pinched negatively curved manifolds with totally geodesic boundaries.
                    We show that the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue is bounded below in terms of the total volume and
                    boundary area when the dimension is at least three. In particular, it shows that Steklov eigenvalues
                    can only tend to zero when the total volume and/or boundary area go to infinity. It can be seen as a
                    counterpart of the lower bound for the first nonzero Laplace eigenvalues on closed pinched
                    negatively curved manifolds of dimension at least three as proved by Schoen in 1982. This is joint
                    work with Ara Basmajian, Asma Hassannezhad and Antoine Métras.

                    In the talk first we will present how to establish a weighted Reilly formula for differential forms
                    on a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary. Then we give some applications of this formula. One
                    is a sharp lower bound for the first positive eigenvalue of the Steklov eigenvalue problem on
                    differential forms investigated by Belishev and Sharafutdinov (2008) and Karpukhin (2019). A second
                    one is a comparison result between the spectrum of this Steklov eigenvalue problem and the spectrum
                    of the Hodge Laplacian on the boundary of the manifold. At the end we discuss an open problem for
                    differential forms analogous to Escobar's conjecture (1999) for functions. The talk will be mainly
                    based on the preprint arXiv:2312.16780.
