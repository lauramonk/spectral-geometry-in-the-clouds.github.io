                    I will talk about comparison principles in (spectral) geometry, describe related phenomena and applications to eigenvalue inequalities. In particular, I will tell about new inequalities for Laplace eigenvalues in terms of Berger’s embolic volume. Time permitting, I will also discuss comparison principles and eigenvalue bounds for minimal surfaces.

                    Shape optimisation is a recurrent theme in spectral geometry: given an operator
and some boundary conditions, what is the optimal domain for the associated
eigenvalue problem. Traditionally, different boundary conditions and different
operators are treated independently. I will present a unifying framework based
on measure theory for treating many different optimisation problem at once, and
to relate them to one another.

As an application, we will see that from the shape optimisation perspective, the
Steklov, Laplace, and Neumann problems can be regrouped as part of a larger
class, and how to use those methods to look for optimisers and their properties.

                    In joint work with San Vũ Ngọc we study classical and quantum systems
with one degree of freedom, for which the energy profile (defined on a
surface) reaches its minimum on a closed curve. A typical example is a
massive particle moving on a circle and subject to a magnetic field. The
quantum version of such problems is, in particular, useful as an
effective model for studying magnetic fields in several degrees of
freedom, and we exhibit an oscillation phenomenon for small eigenvalues,
similar to the "Little-Parks" in supraconductors. <br>
In this talk, I will show how to "solve" the classical problem, that is,
find good coordinates which simplify it: Then I will discuss the quantum
version of this simplification, and notably the origin of these
oscillations. <br>
This talk is, hopefully, accessible without any particular knowledge of
semiclassical analysis.

                    In this talk we present a new type of boundary conditions for the
Bilaplacian, that we will call Robin boundary conditions. This new problem can
be thought of as a model for elastically supported plates, and moreover turns
out to be closely related to the study of spaces of traces of Sobolev functions.
We will start by recalling some known properties of the Robin Laplacian as a
motivation for its fourth-order counterpart, then we will introduce the Robin
Bilaplacian operator. We will then analyze the dependence of the operator,
its eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions on the Robin parameters, with a particular
focus on the asymptotics as the parameters tend to infinity. We will conclude by
considering the dependence on smooth perturbations of the domain, computing
the shape derivatives of the eigenvalues and giving a characterization for critical
domains under volume and perimeter constraints.

                    With Greg Berkolaiko, Yaiza Canzani and Graham Cox, we consider a family of periodic tight-binding models (which are combinatorial graphs with Laplacian operators that have edge weights parametrized over tori).  It will be important that our graphs have the minimal number of links between copies of the fundamental domain. For this family of graphs, we establish a local condition of second derivative type under which the critical points of the dispersion relation can be recognized as global maxima or minima. We will try to give an introduction to periodic graphs, as well as their applications.  In addition, we will demonstrate our results with a number of example graphs.

                    The second eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian is maximal for a ball under volume normalization, by Weinberger (1956). For simply connected planar domains, Szegö did it two years earlier using conformal mapping. The third eigenvalue is maximal for a disjoint union of two balls having the same size, by Bucur and Henrot (2019). For simply connected planar domains, Girouard, Nadirashvili and Polterovich did it ten years earlier. This talk explores the general approach of these authors in terms of trial functions constructed by even reflection (“folding over a hyperplane”), and provides a new proof of a key step in Bucur and Henrot’s argument. A starring role is played by a homotopy result of Petrides that has the flavor of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. This new approach yields a two-ball upper bound on the third eigenvalue for domains in hyperbolic space. (Joint work with Pedro Freitas.)

                    The hot spots conjecture says that a second Neumann
eigenfunction of a domain in a Euclidean space can not attain its global
extrema in the interior of the domain. I shall try to provide a brief
survey of the known results on this topic. In particular, I will try to
explain a recent result of myself with Chris Judge that provides an
affirmative answer to the conjecture for triangular domains in the plane.

                    Among optimization problems for eigenvalues od Euclidean domains, the
most common
geometric constraints which have been considered are the volume or
perimeter constraints.
Here in this talk we consider a constraint on the diameter.
First, we consider the minimization of the Dirichlet eigenvalues. It is easy
to see that the minimizer exists and is a convex domain of constant width.
Then we prove that the disk is a local minimizer only for a finite (and
explicit)
list of indices. At last, we study the limit of the optimal domain for
\(\lambda_k\) when \(k\to \infty\).
Then, we consider the problem of maximizing the \(k\)-th Steklov
eigenvalue among
convex domains. Existence of a maximizer is not difficult to prove.
Even if the disk is always a critical point, we prove that it is never
a maximizer. We also prove that, for the optimal domain, the eigenvalue
is always multiple.
In both cases, we present some numerical results.

                    The Steklov problem consists of studying the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the Dirichlet to Neumann map on a compact manifold, \(M\), with boundary. While the high energy behavior of the eigenfunctions on the boundary of \(M\) resembles that of high energy Laplace eigenfunctions, their behavior in the interior of \(M\) is very different. In this talk, we discuss the decay and oscillatory properties of these eigenfunctions in the interior of \(M\).

                    The relationship between the Steklov eigenvalues of a Riemannian manifold and the geometry of its boundary has received a great deal of attention in recent years.
One way to gain insight into this relationship is to obtain bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues in terms of some of the geometric quantities of the manifold and its boundary.
We first recall some known geometric upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues of a Riemannian manifold.
We then consider the Steklov eigenvalues of a submanifold of Euclidean space and present
some geometric upper bounds involving the intersection index of the manifold and that of its boundary.

                    The spectra of large locally uniform geometries 
have been studied widely and from different points of view,
including in applications. They include Ramanujan Graphs and Buildings,
euclidean and hyperbolic spaces and more general locally symmetric spaces. We review some of these briefly highlighting rigidity features. We then focus on the simplest case of finite cubic graphs which prove to be surprisingly rich. As one imposes restrictions on these graphs, planarity, fullerenes, ... their spectra become rigid.
Joint work with Alicia Kollar and Fan Wei.

                    The results of this talk have been obtained in collaboration with
Chiu-Yen Kao and Braxton Osting. <br>
The first part of the talk is dedicated to Nash's isometric embedding
theorem for surfaces. We recall the impressive results obtained by
HEVEA's project for the flat torus  (V. Borrelli, F. Lazarus, B. Thibert
et al.) and illustrate how spectral formulation may lead to a new
intrinsic numerical approach which are not related to Gromov's construction.<br>
Following the theoretical results of Fraser and Schoen, we describe in a
second part a numerical process to approximate minimal surfaces in the
ball. That is surfaces contained in the ball; that have zero mean curvature; and
meet the boundary of the ball orthogonally.
<br>
For genus \(\gamma=0\) and \(b= 2, \cdots , 9, 12, 15, 20\) boundary components, we
numerically solve the extremal Steklov problem for the first eigenvalue.
The corresponding eigenfunctions generate a free boundary minimal
surface, which have not been observed previously.

                    We consider the Dirichlet Laplace operator in a bounded domain with Lipschitz-
regular boundary and study the asymptotic behaviour of its eigenvalues. In particular,
we prove a two-term asymptotic expansion for the sum of eigenvalues and show that the
obtained remainder is optimal. <br>
The talk is based on joint work with Rupert Frank.

                    In this talk I will present some work with Rozenblum from 2009. While it has been known for more than half a century that the Laplace operator on a smooth, bounded domain may have essential spectrum if the boundary conditions are suitably chosen, typical choices involved non-local operators. In this talk I will show, with very elementary arguments, that even local boundary conditions, singular even just at a single point - can have a huge impact on the spectrum and eigenfunctions. The example we consider, first proposed by Berry and Dennis. still has empty essential spectrum and compact resolvent. However Weyl’s law fails completely because the spectrum becomes unbounded below. The positive eigenvalues still obey Weyl asymptotics, to leading order; however the (absolute values of the) negative eigenvalues do not obey a power law distribution. <br>
I will also make some remarks and ask some questions about nodal domains, which were not addressed in our paper.
